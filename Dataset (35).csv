***

### **Predictive Actions for SEBI Circular SEBI/HO/DDHS/DDHS-PoD-2/P/CIR/2025/114**

This circular significantly simplifies and standardizes the process for converting a private listed Infrastructure Investment Trust (InvIT) into a public InvIT by aligning its public issue requirements with those of a follow-on offer (FPO) rather than an initial public offer (IPO). The actions below are for affected entities to proactively adapt to these changes.

### High

*   **Immediate Review of Ongoing and Planned Conversions:** Any private InvIT currently in the process of or planning a conversion to a public InvIT must immediately halt and review its offer documents, timelines, and compliance checklists. All documentation must be revised to align with the procedural and disclosure requirements of a follow-on offer as mandated. Failure to do so will result in regulatory rejection.
*   **Update Legal and Compliance Frameworks:** Merchant bankers, legal advisors, and compliance teams must immediately update their internal standard operating procedures (SOPs), templates for Draft Offer Documents (DODs), and due diligence checklists. The terminology must be changed from ""initial offer"" to ""follow-on offer,"" and all regulatory cross-references must point to the InvIT Regulations applicable to FPOs.
*   **Re-evaluate Sponsor Lock-in and Unitholding:** Sponsors and sponsor groups of private InvITs must re-assess their unitholding and lock-in strategies. The circular clarifies that the standard minimum unitholding and lock-in requirements under Regulation 12 of the InvIT Regulations apply. This may alter financial models and exit strategies previously planned under different assumptions.

### Medium

*   **Strategic Assessment by Private InvITs:** Private InvITs that previously found the conversion process too cumbersome (due to IPO-like requirements) should conduct a strategic reassessment. The streamlined FPO-like process reduces time-to-market and compliance costs, potentially making a public conversion a more attractive option for raising growth capital.
*   **Training and Sensitization for Internal Teams:** All parties to InvITs, especially investment banking and legal teams, must conduct urgent training sessions. Teams that were specialized in IPOs may need to collaborate with or hand over responsibilities to teams experienced in FPOs to ensure a smooth transition and execution under the new framework.
*   **Update Systems and Processes at Market Infrastructure Institutions (MIIs):** Recognised Stock Exchanges and Depositories must update their internal systems, listing application forms, and processing workflows. They need to ensure that applications for the conversion of private InvITs are now categorized and processed under the FPO framework to avoid procedural delays.

### Low

*   **Enhance Investor Communication Materials:** InvITs and merchant bankers should proactively update their investor education materials and roadshow presentations. They must clearly communicate that the public issue is for the conversion of an existing, operational, and privately-listed entity, not a new one, aligning investor expectations with the nature of a follow-on offer.
*   **Benchmark Timelines and Costs:** Market participants should create new benchmarks for the time and cost associated with converting a private InvIT to a public one. This data will be valuable for advising future clients and for internal financial planning, as the FPO route is typically faster and more cost-effective than a full-fledged IPO.
*   **Establish a Feedback Loop with the Regulator:** The Bharat InvITs Association and other market participants should monitor the implementation of these changes. After the first few conversions are completed under the new framework, they should collate feedback on the process and present it to SEBI's Hybrid Securities Advisory Committee (HySAC) for any further refinements.",Passed,"- The summary accurately captures all the key points from the source document in a clear and well-structured manner.
- It correctly identifies the main subject: the amendment to the framework for converting a *private listed InvIT into a public InvIT*.
- It precisely details the two main changes: 
    1. Streamlining the *minimum contribution and lock-in requirements* for sponsors.
    2. Aligning the public offer procedure with that of a *""follow-on offer""* instead of an *""initial offer""*.
- The summary also includes important contextual details such as the *effective date (August 08, 2025)*, the basis for the changes (*recommendations from HySAC*), and the directive for dissemination.
- Since the summary is comprehensive, accurate, and well-organized, a different evaluation is not appropriate."

Madam/ Sir,

**Subject: Transaction charges paid to Mutual Fund Distributors**

1. Paragraph 10.5 read with paragraph 10.4.1.b of SEBI Master Circular for Mutual Funds dated June 27, 2024 (Master Circular) allows AMCs to pay to the distributor transaction charges, subject to a minimum subscription amount of INR 10,000/- brought in by such distributors.

2. The public consultation on the captioned subject matter was carried out in May 2023 followed by an industry consultation in June 2025.

3. Based on the feedback received from the industry and considering that distributors as an agents of AMCs are entitled to be remunerated by the AMCs, the charges or commission, as prescribed under the paragraph 10.4.1.b and paragraph 10.5 of Master Circular, shall be done away with.

4. Accordingly, paragraphs 10.4.1.b and 10.5 of Master Circular stands deleted.

### **Predictive Actions for Mutual Funds, AMCs, and RTAs**

---

### High

*   **Immediately Halt Transaction Charge Payouts:** Direct the finance and operations teams to cease all payments of transaction charges to distributors as specified under the now-deleted paragraphs 10.4.1.b and 10.5 of the Master Circular. This action must be implemented with immediate effect to ensure compliance.
*   **Update Payment Processing Systems:** Instruct IT departments and Registrar and Transfer Agents (RTAs) to immediately reconfigure their software and systems to stop the calculation and accrual of these transaction charges for all new subscriptions.
*   **Issue Urgent Communication to Distributors:** Draft and disseminate an immediate notification to all empaneled distributors and partners, clearly stating the abolition of the transaction charges, citing the SEBI circular, and specifying the effective date. This will prevent disputes and manage partner expectations.
*   **Conduct an Emergency Compliance Review:** The compliance department must immediately update its internal compliance checklist and manuals to reflect the deletion of the relevant clauses from the Master Circular and confirm that all operational changes are in line with the new regulation.

### Medium

*   **Review and Amend Distributor Agreements:** The legal and business development teams should identify and amend all existing agreements with distributors that reference the payment of transaction charges. Prepare addendums or revised contracts for circulation.
*   **Assess Impact on Distributor Relations and Business:** Analyze the potential financial impact on distributors and predict any resultant changes in their behavior (e.g., reduced focus on smaller ticket investors). The sales and distribution teams should prepare a strategy to maintain a strong relationship with the distributor network.
*   **Update Internal SOPs and Train Staff:** Revise all internal Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) related to distributor payouts and commission processing. Conduct training sessions for sales, operations, and customer service teams to ensure they understand the change and can handle queries from distributors and investors accurately.
*   **Prepare Investor Communication:** Develop a clear and concise communication template for investor relations and customer service teams to use in response to any queries regarding this change, framing it as a measure taken by the regulator in the interest of investors.

### Low

*   **Monitor Distributor Performance and Inflow Trends:** Over the next 6-12 months, track data on mutual fund inflows, particularly from subscriptions around the INR 10,000 mark, to analyze the long-term impact of this policy change on business volume and distributor engagement.
*   **Revise Distributor Compensation Strategy:** Evaluate the overall compensation and incentive structure for distributors. Consider if alternative performance-based incentives are needed to ensure distributors remain motivated to source investments across all ticket sizes.
*   **Update Marketing and Training Materials:** Review and remove any mention of transaction charges from all marketing collateral, product brochures, websites, and distributor training modules to ensure all public-facing information is accurate and compliant.
*   **Conduct a Post-Implementation Audit:** Schedule a formal audit within 3-6 months to verify that the cessation of transaction charge payments has been fully and correctly implemented across all systems and processes, with no legacy errors.",Passed,"The summary is a clear, well-structured, and accurate representation of the source document.
- It correctly identifies the main subject of the circular, which is the elimination of transaction charges paid to Mutual Fund Distributors.
- All key details are included, such as the specific paragraphs being deleted (`10.4.1.b` and `10.5`), the entities the circular applies to, the rationale behind the decision (public and industry consultations), and the immediate effective date (`August 08, 2025`).

4. IAs and RAs shall comply with the deposit requirements latest by September 30, 2025.

5. IAASB/RAASB (BSE Limited) is hereby directed to put in place necessary systems and procedures for implementation of the provisions of this circular and bring the same to the notice of IAs/RAs.

*   **For Investment Advisers (IAs) and Research Analysts (RAs): Conduct Cost-Benefit Analysis and Make a Decision**

*   **Perform a Root Cause Analysis and Risk Assessment:** Analyze the reasons for the initial delay to identify bottlenecks in system development or testing processes. Conduct a fresh risk assessment based on the new timeline, identifying potential risks that could jeopardize the October 10 launch. Develop and document mitigation plans for these identified risks.
*   **Prepare for Post-Implementation Support:** Formulate a detailed post-launch support plan, including a ""hyper-care"" period immediately following October 10, 2025. This plan should include dedicated support teams, clear escalation matrices for technical issues, and a monitoring system to track the performance and stability of the new pledge/re-pledge mechanism in a live environment.

### **Low**

*   **Update Client-Facing Educational Material:** Brokers and depositories should review and update all client-facing communication, including website FAQs, tutorials, and informational brochures, to reflect the new implementation date. This ensures end-investors receive accurate and timely information, preventing confusion.
*   **Document Lessons Learned for Future Projects:** Create a formal ""lessons learned"" document from this implementation cycle. This should capture challenges faced, reasons for the timeline extension, and successful strategies used. This documentation will serve as a valuable reference for managing future large-scale system upgrade projects more effectively.
*   **Review and Refine Internal Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):** Member brokers should use the additional time to thoroughly review and refine their internal SOPs for margin management, risk assessment, and client reporting under the new system. This ensures that internal operational workflows are fully aligned and optimized for the new process well before the go-live date.",Passed,"The evaluation is given because the summary is exceptionally clear, accurate, and well-structured.

- The content is organized using bullet points that group information by the relevant entities (**SEBI**, **Depositories**, **Stock Exchanges**), making it easy to understand the roles and directives for each.
- It accurately captures all critical data points, including the original implementation date (**September 01, 2025**), the new extended date (**October 10, 2025**), and the specific reason for the extension (a request from **CDSL and NSDL** for system development and testing).
- A different value is not possible as the summary effectively preserves all essential information and the core meaning of the source document in a clear and organized manner."

***

### Predictive Actions for Stock Brokers

#### High
*   **Update Compliance Calendar Immediately:** Revise all internal compliance calendars, trackers, and reminder systems to reflect the new deadlines: **May 31st** for the half-year ending March 31st, and **November 15th** for the half-year ending September 30th. This is critical to prevent non-compliance and ensure the continuation of the margin trading facility.
*   **Inform Auditors of New Timelines:** Immediately communicate the extended deadlines to the appointed auditors. This will allow them to adjust their audit and certification schedules, ensuring a smoother and more accurate process without last-minute pressure.
*   **Internal Dissemination:** Circulate the update to key internal departments, including Compliance, Finance, and Senior Management, to ensure universal awareness and alignment with the revised timelines for financial data preparation and review.

#### Medium
*   **Revise Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):** Update the internal SOPs related to regulatory filings and net worth certification to formally incorporate the new deadlines. This ensures the change is institutionalized and not dependent on individual memory.
*   **Re-evaluate Resource Allocation:** Analyze and adjust the workload planning for the finance and compliance teams, especially around the financial year-end. The extension from 30 to 60 days for the March submission provides significant relief and should be factored into resource management to improve efficiency and reduce employee burnout.
*   **Conduct a Proactive Compliance Check:** Use the extended timeframe to perform a more detailed review of the net worth computation before submission. This reduces the risk of errors, potential regulatory queries, or the need for subsequent corrections.

#### Low
*   **Provide Feedback to Industry Associations:** Acknowledge the role of market participant representations in this change. Provide positive feedback to relevant industry bodies (e.g., ANMI, BSE Brokers' Forum), strengthening their ability to advocate for practical regulatory adjustments in the future.
*   **Review Client Communication Strategy:** While not mandatory, consider proactively informing key institutional clients or High Net-worth Individuals (HNIs) about your firm's adherence to the updated regulations, reinforcing your commitment to compliance and transparency.
*   **Benchmark Other Regulatory Deadlines:** Use this harmonization as a precedent to internally review other overlapping or strenuous regulatory deadlines. Identify other areas where a similar alignment could promote ""ease of doing business"" and propose them through industry channels.

***

### Predictive Actions for Stock Exchanges

#### High
*   **Amend Bye-Laws and Rulebooks:** Initiate the formal process to amend the exchange's relevant bye-laws, rules, and regulations to reflect the new submission dates as mandated in point 6.1 of the circular.
*   **Update Compliance Monitoring Systems:** Immediately reconfigure the automated compliance and surveillance systems that track broker submissions. The system logic must be updated to the new deadlines (May 31st and November 15th) to prevent compliant brokers from being incorrectly flagged for late submission.
*   **Issue a Notice to Members:** Disseminate the SEBI circular to all member stockbrokers through an official exchange notice or circular. Ensure the communication clearly highlights the old vs. new deadlines and the immediate effect of the change.

#### Medium
*   **Update Publicly Available Information:** Revise all relevant sections on the exchange website, including FAQs, compliance checklists, and guidance notes for members, to ensure all information is consistent with the new timelines.
*   **Train Internal Teams:** Conduct a brief training or orientation for the exchange's compliance, inspection, and member relations departments. Ensure staff are aware of the new rules to handle member queries accurately and manage the monitoring process effectively.
*   **Prepare for Query Management:** Anticipate an increase in queries from brokers seeking clarification in the first submission cycle after the change. Prepare standardized responses and brief the support team to handle these queries efficiently.

#### Low
*   **Analyze Submission Data Post-Implementation:** After the first submission cycle with the new deadlines, analyze the submission patterns. Assess whether the extended timeline leads to better quality submissions or if most brokers still submit early. This data can provide valuable insights for future regulatory discussions.
*   **Solicit Member Feedback:** After a couple of submission cycles, gather feedback from member brokers on the impact of the revised timelines on their operational efficiency. This feedback can be shared with SEBI to demonstrate the positive outcome of the ""ease of doing business"" initiative.",Passed,"- The summary is well-structured, using bullet points to clearly organize the information into logical sections like `Primary Objective`, `Reason for Change`, `Revised Deadlines`, and `Action Required`.
- It accurately captures all the critical information from the source document, including the specific old and new deadlines for submitting the net worth certificate.
- The summary correctly identifies the final revised deadlines as **May 31st** and **November 15th**, demonstrating a correct interpretation of the document's definitive rule change mentioned in paragraph 4.
- All key details, such as the reason for the change (harmonization for ease of doing business) and the immediate effective date, are correctly included.
- A different selection is not possible as the summary is a clear, accurate, and comprehensive representation of the source document, fulfilling all requirements for a high-quality summary."

***
Page 6 of 11
***
**Clarification:** Above-mentioned guidelines shall now be read as under: REs shall implement suggested strategies/ methodologies such as Zero-trust networks, segmentation, no single point of failure, high availability, etc. Further, the same shall be approved by IT committee for REs.

6.3. **Mobile Application Security guidelines (PR.AA.S16 and corresponding guidelines - Page 102-103)**
**Clarification:** Above-mentioned guidelines are recommendatory (not mandatory) in nature.

6.4. **RS.CO.S2 guidelines (Page 124-125):** “If the cyber-attack is of high impact and has a broad reach, the RE shall give a press release which shall include (but not limited to) a brief of the incident, actions taken to recover, normal operation resumption status (once achieved), etc. and inform all the affected customers/ stakeholders. If the cyber-attack is of low impact and has a narrow/low reach, the REs shall inform all the affected customers/ stakeholders.""
**Clarification:** Above-mentioned guidelines shall now be read as under: REs shall take action as per their approved Cyber Crisis Management Plan (CCMP).

6.5. **DE.CM.S3 guidelines (3.c) (Page 119):** “REs shall deploy solutions such as BAS, CART, decoy, vulnerability management, etc. to enhance their cybersecurity posture.”
**Clarification:** Above-mentioned guideline shall now be read as under: It is recommended that REs consider deploying a range of security solutions in consultation with their IT Committee, such as threat simulation, vulnerability management, and decoy systems, to assess and enhance their cybersecurity posture.

6.9. **On boarding to Market-SOC (Box Item 11)**
**Clarification:** small-size and self-certification with few exclusions as mentioned in (CSCRF Box Item 11, DE.CM.S3 Guidelines (c-d) – Page 118) and (Clause 2.2, 2.6, 2.7 and 3 of SEBI circular vide SEBI/HO/ ITD-1/ITD_CSC_EXT/P/CIR/2025/60 dated April 30, 2025) have been mandated to be on boarded on Market-SOC. Please refer Q. 60 of CSCRF FAQs¹ issued vide dated June 11, 2025:
**Question:** In a scenario where an RE falling under small-size or self-certification REs category has its own SOC, is it necessary for such REs to get onboarded to Market-SOC?
**Answer:** It is imperative that setting up own SOC is a costly proposition. Hence, SEBI has mandated NSE and BSE to setup Market-SOC (M-SOC) where small-size REs and self-certification REs can get onboarded and take the benefit to stay cyber secure and resilient. However, REs who have their own SOC and falling under the category of small-size REs or self-certification REs by virtue of their regulatory activity may leverage their existing SOC. Further, such REs shall be required to submit the SOC efficacy report

periodically as mandated in CSCRF.

6.10. **RC.RP.S2 guideline (Page 128-129):** “In the event of disruption of any one or more of the critical systems, the RE shall, within 30 minutes of the incident, declare that incident as ‘Disaster' based on the business impact analysis. Accordingly, the RTO shall be two (2) hours as recommended by IOSCO² for the resumption of critical operations. The RPO shall be 15 minutes for all REs. The recovery plan shall be scenario-based and in line with the RTO and RPO specified.""
**Clarification:** Above-mentioned guideline shall now be read as under as referred from IOSCO³: Resumption within two hours (i.e. two-hour RTO). REs shall design and test its systems and processes to enable the safe resumption of critical operations within two hours of a disruption, even in the case of extreme but plausible scenarios. Notwithstanding this capability to resume critical operations within two hours, when dealing with a disruption REs shall exercise judgment in effecting resumption so that risks to itself or its ecosystem do not thereby escalate. In consultation with their IT Committee, REs shall also plan for scenarios in which the resumption objective is not achieved.
Further, RPO for critical systems shall be 15 minutes as per SEBI circular⁴ dated March 22, 2021.

6.11. **Requirement of ISO 27001 certification for Qualified REs (PR.IP.S16 (Page 66) and corresponding guideline (Page 115), and Section 4.2 - Page 47)**
**Clarification:** Qualified REs are encouraged and recommended (not mandatory) to obtain ISO 27001 certification.

6.12. While receiving and handling cyber audit reports submitted by their members, Stock Exchanges and Depositories shall ensure that adequate safeguards are in place to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such reports.

***","*   This circular provides technical clarifications, revises categorizations, and introduces compliance principles for the Cybersecurity and Cyber Resilience Framework (CSCRF) for all SEBI Regulated Entities (REs).
*   **For REs Regulated by Multiple Bodies (e.g., RBI):**
    *   **Principle of Exclusivity:** The CSCRF scope is limited to systems and processes used exclusively for SEBI-regulated activities. Shared infrastructure is included only if not covered by the primary regulator's audit.
    *   **Principle of Equivalence:** Compliance with an equivalent cybersecurity control from a primary regulator (like RBI) is considered as compliance with the corresponding CSCRF control.
*   **For All Regulated Entities (General Clarifications):**
    *   The definition of ""Critical Systems"" is clarified to include any ancillary system on the same network segment as core systems.
    *   REs must implement a zero-trust security model, with strategies approved by their IT Committee.
    *   In case of a cyber-attack, REs must take action as per their approved Cyber Crisis Management Plan (CCMP), replacing the previous guideline on issuing press releases.
    *   The Recovery Time Objective (RTO) for critical systems is clarified to be two hours, while the Recovery Point Objective (RPO) remains 15 minutes.
    *   Only the summary of VAPT and Cyber Audit reports must be submitted as per the specified format; explicit vulnerabilities should not be submitted unless specifically requested by SEBI.
    *   NCIIPC guidelines for Critical Information Infrastructure are applicable only to those REs officially identified as CII by NCIIPC.
    *   Small-size or self-certification REs with their own Security Operations Center (SOC) can leverage it instead of onboarding to the Market-SOC, but they must submit a periodic SOC efficacy report.
    *   REs are directed to follow the comprehensive Cyber Security Audit Policy Guidelines issued by CERT-In.
*   **Changes from Mandatory to Recommendatory:**
    *   Mobile Application Security guidelines are now recommendatory, not mandatory.
    *   Deploying specific security solutions like BAS, CART, and decoy systems is recommended, not mandatory, and should be done in consultation with the IT Committee.
    *   Obtaining ISO 27001 certification for Qualified REs is encouraged and recommended, but not mandatory.
*   **For Portfolio Managers (PMs):**
    *   The categorization thresholds based on Assets Under Management (AUM) for CSCRF compliance have been revised:
        *   **Mid-size:** AUM of ₹10,000 crores and above.
        *   **Small-size:** AUM between ₹3,000 crores and ₹10,000 crores.
        *   **Self-certification:** AUM below ₹3,000 crores.
*   **For Merchant Bankers (MBs):**
    *   All ""active"" MBs (those who have undertaken any merchant banking activity) are categorized as Small-size REs for CSCRF purposes.
    *   ""Inactive"" MBs are now exempt from the CSCRF framework.
*   **For Stock Exchanges, Depositories, and BSE Limited:**
    *   They are directed to amend their byelaws and rules to implement these clarifications.
    *   They must notify their respective members, participants, Investment Advisers, and Research Analysts of these changes and disseminate the circular on their websites.
    *   Stock Exchanges and Depositories must ensure adequate safeguards to maintain the confidentiality of cyber audit reports submitted by their members.","### Predictive Actions for SEBI Circular on Cybersecurity Framework (CSCRF)

This circular provides significant technical clarifications, introduces principles for entities under multiple regulators, and re-categorizes certain entities. The following actions are predicted to be necessary for compliance and strategic alignment.

### High

*   **Conduct Immediate Scope Re-assessment for Multi-Regulated Entities:**
    Entities regulated by other bodies (e.g., RBI) must immediately conduct a detailed analysis of their systems and controls based on the new **Principle of Exclusivity** and **Principle of Equivalence**. This requires mapping all systems to determine which are exclusively for SEBI-regulated activities and which controls are covered by the primary regulator's framework. The outcome will redefine the scope of the SEBI CSCRF audit and must be documented for submission.

*   **Update IT Governance and Policy Documents:**
    Review and amend key governance documents to reflect the clarifications. Specifically, the **Cyber Crisis Management Plan (CCMP)** must be updated to be the primary guide for incident response, replacing the previous prescriptive press release requirement. Policies related to zero-trust architecture, security solution deployment, and supply-chain risk must be formally presented to and approved by the IT Committee.

*   **Re-evaluate Entity Categorization (For Portfolio Managers & Merchant Bankers):**
    Portfolio Managers must immediately recalculate their Assets Under Management (AUM) against the revised thresholds to determine their new category (Mid-size, Small-size, Self-certification). Merchant Bankers must assess their activity status to confirm if they are ""Small-size REs"" or ""Exempt."" This re-categorization directly impacts the applicable compliance requirements and must be actioned without delay.

### Medium

*   **Revise CSCRF Implementation Roadmap and Budgets:**
    Adjust project plans and resource allocation for CSCRF implementation. De-prioritize or re-scope efforts for requirements that are now **recommendatory** (e.g., ISO 27001 certification, Mobile Application Security guidelines), freeing up resources for mandatory controls. The roadmap must align with the re-assessed scope from the High-priority actions.

*   **Update Critical Systems Inventory:**
    Revisit and update the inventory of IT assets based on the clarified definition of ""Critical Systems."" The inclusion of ""any other system which is on the same network segment"" widens the scope. Ensure all such ancillary systems are correctly identified, classified, and brought under the purview of relevant security controls.

*   **Finalize Market-SOC Strategy:**
    Small-size and self-certification REs that have their own Security Operations Center (SOC) must establish a process to generate and submit the required **SOC efficacy report**. REs in these categories without a SOC must expedite their onboarding process with the mandated Market-SOC (M-SOC) provided by NSE and BSE.

*   **Communicate Changes to Auditors and Internal Teams:**
    Organize briefing sessions for internal IT, compliance, and risk teams, as well as the appointed CERT-In empanelled auditors. Ensure all stakeholders understand the revised scope, clarified definitions, and updated reporting requirements to prevent misinterpretations during the audit cycle.

### Low

*   **Standardize Audit Report Submission Process:**
    Develop a strict internal process and template for submitting the **summary** of VAPT and Cyber Audit reports as per the CSCRF format. Train staff to ensure that detailed vulnerability data is not submitted unless explicitly requested by SEBI, thereby minimizing inadvertent information disclosure.

*   **Review and Align with CERT-In Audit Guidelines:**
    Procure the comprehensive ""Cyber Security Audit Policy Guidelines"" from CERT-In and conduct a gap analysis against current audit practices. Ensure that both internal procedures and the scope of work for external auditors are fully aligned with these national-level guidelines for consistency and effectiveness.

*   **Enhance IT Committee Engagement Framework:**
    Formalize the engagement model with the IT Committee. Schedule regular agenda items to cover mandatory consultations and approvals mentioned in the circular, such as zero-trust strategy, deployment of security solutions, and cyber-supply chain risk assessments. Maintain detailed minutes of these discussions as evidence of compliance.",Passed,"The evaluation is based on the summary's high quality in terms of structure, clarity, and accuracy.

- The summary is exceptionally well-structured, using thematic headings (e.g., **'For REs Regulated by Multiple Bodies'**, **'For Portfolio Managers (PMs)'**) that organize the complex information logically and enhance readability.
- It successfully captures all critical policy shifts and key points, including the introduction of the **'Principle of Exclusivity'** and **'Principle of Equivalence'**.
- The content is accurate, correctly reflecting important details such as the revised AUM thresholds for Portfolio Managers (e.g., **Mid-size: ₹10,000 crores and above**) and the new categorization for Merchant Bankers (**'active' vs. 'inactive'**).
- It correctly identifies several guidelines that have been changed from mandatory to recommendatory, such as **Mobile Application Security** and **ISO 27001 certification** for Qualified REs.

A different evaluation is not possible as the summary is a clear, comprehensive, and accurate representation of the source document, showing no omissions of important information or lack of clarity."

Page 3 of 3","*   This circular extends the compliance deadlines for all Regulated Entities (REs) regarding the 'Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016' circular dated July 31, 2025.
*   The deadline to submit a compliance/action taken report and a list of digital platforms is extended by one month to September 30, 2025.

*   The reporting authority for Investment Advisors (IAs) and Research Analysts (RAs) for this compliance is now BSE Ltd.
*   Stock Brokers and Depository Participants will report to Stock Exchanges/Depositories, while MIIs and all other REs will report to SEBI.","Based on the SEBI circular regarding the extension of timelines for digital accessibility compliance, here are the predictive actions for the Regulated Entities (REs) affected.

### High

*   **Revise Internal Project Timelines and Roadmaps**
    Immediately update all internal project plans, Gantt charts, and compliance calendars to reflect the new deadlines. This is critical for resource allocation, budget planning, and preventing missed deadlines despite the extension. Key dates to update are the appointment of the auditor (Dec 14, 2025), completion of the audit (April 30, 2026), and remediation of findings (July 31, 2026).

*   **Update Compliance Reporting Matrix and Contact Lists**
    For Investment Advisors (IAs) and Research Analysts (RAs), the change in reporting authority from BASL/SEBI to BSE Ltd. is a critical operational update. Immediately revise internal compliance matrices, automated reporting workflows, and contact lists to ensure that all future submissions related to this circular are directed to the correct authority. Submitting to the wrong entity constitutes a compliance failure.

*   **Initiate Vendor Selection for IAAP Auditors**
    Although the deadline for appointing an IAAP (International Association of Accessibility Professionals) certified auditor has been extended to December 2025, the pool of certified professionals is limited. REs should use this extra time to immediately begin the process of identifying, vetting, and shortlisting qualified auditors. Delaying this could lead to a supply crunch and higher costs closer to the deadline.

### Medium

*   **Conduct an Internal Pre-Audit and Gap Analysis**
    Use the extended timeline to perform an internal assessment of all digital platforms (websites, mobile apps, client portals) against WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards. This proactive step will help in understanding the potential scope of non-compliance, estimating the effort required for remediation, and preparing for the official audit, making the process smoother and more predictable.

*   **Re-evaluate and Adjust Budgetary Allocations**
    The extended timelines for the audit and remediation will shift the associated costs to a later financial period. Financial planning and budgeting teams must review and adjust their allocations for FY 2025-26 and FY 2026-27 to account for expenses related to the audit, potential platform redevelopment, and specialized vendor fees.

*   **Communicate Updated Plan to Key Stakeholders**
    Disseminate the revised timelines and project plan to all internal stakeholders, including IT, legal, compliance, product development, and senior management. Clear communication will ensure alignment across departments and prevent confusion arising from the deadline extensions.

### Low

*   **Integrate Accessibility into the Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**
    Instead of treating accessibility as a one-time compliance fix, use this opportunity to embed accessibility principles into the standard software development lifecycle. Train developers, UI/UX designers, and quality assurance teams on accessibility best practices. This ""shift-left"" approach will reduce the cost and effort of future remediation and ensure ongoing compliance for the annual audits starting in 2027.

*   **Establish a Long-Term Accessibility Governance Framework**
    The requirement for an *annual* accessibility audit (starting April 30, 2027) indicates that this is an ongoing obligation. Develop a formal governance framework that assigns ownership for digital accessibility, sets policies for new digital products, and creates a process for continuous monitoring and improvement.

*   **Monitor for Further Regulatory Clarifications**
    SEBI granted these extensions based on representations from REs, suggesting the initial requirements were challenging. Assign a compliance officer to monitor for any further circulars, FAQs, or guidance from SEBI on this matter. Staying informed will allow for quick adaptation to any future changes.",Passed,"The evaluation is based on the summary's adherence to the criteria of clarity, structure, and inclusion of key information.

- The summary is **well-structured**, using a bullet-point format that clearly separates and presents each key piece of information, making it easy to read and understand.
- It **accurately captures all essential details** from the source document. This includes:
    - The extension of the deadline for submitting the compliance/action report to `September 30, 2025`.
    - The new deadline for appointing an auditor, which is `December 14, 2025`.
    - The revised dates for the accessibility audit (`April 30, 2026`), remediation (`July 31, 2026`), and the next annual audit (`April 30, 2027`).
    - The updated reporting authorities, correctly identifying `BSE Ltd.` for IAs and RAs, `Stock Exchanges/Depositories` for Brokers/DPs, and `SEBI` for MIIs and others.
- The content is **clear and concise**, preserving the essential meaning of the original circular without introducing errors or omitting critical data.
- A different choice is not possible because the summary effectively and accurately condenses the source document, meeting all requirements for a high-quality summary."

**SEBI/HO/MRD/TPD/CIR/P/2025/122**
**September 01, 2025**

To,

All Stock Exchanges,  
All Clearing Corporations,  
All Depositories,

Dear Sir/ Madam,

**Sub: Framework for Intraday Position Limits Monitoring for Equity Index Derivatives**

1. SEBI consultation paper dated February 24, 2025 on ‘Enhancing Trading Convenience and Strengthening Risk Monitoring in Equity Derivatives’, proposed the following Future Equivalent (FutEq) or delta equivalent positions limits for index options:

| S No. | Position type | Limit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | End of day | Net FutEq : ₹500 crores<br>Gross FutEq : ₹1,500 crores |
| 2 | Intraday | Net FutEq : ₹1,000 crores<br>Gross FutEq : ₹2,500 crores |

2. On the basis of feedback received from market participants and subsequent deliberations in Secondary Market Advisory Committee (SMAC) of SEBI as well as with Market Infrastructure Institutions (MIIs), following was stipulated for position limits for index options (Para 5.5 of SEBI circular SEBI/HO/MRD/TPD-1/P/CIR/2025/79 dated May 29, 2025):

| S No. | Position type | Limit | Implementation Timeline |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | End of day | Net FutEq : ₹1,500 crores<br>Gross FutEq : ₹10,000 crores | Glide path : From July 01, 2025 to December 05, 2025<br>Normal implementation : December 06, 2025 |

**SEBI भारतीय प्रतिभूति और विनिमय बोर्ड**
**Securities and Exchange Board of India**

| S No. | Position type | Limit | Implementation Timeline |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2 | Intraday | No limit specifically defined however end of day position limits would be monitored by Stock Exchanges on an intraday basis through random snapshots from the perspective of market integrity / surveillance concerns | July 01, 2025 |

3. On the basis of observed instances of outsized intraday FutEq positions created by certain entities in index options on the day of contract expiry and the risks to market integrity thereof, discussions were held with Stock Exchanges to strengthen the intraday monitoring framework for index options.

4. In view of the aforesaid discussions and after deliberations in SMAC, it is decided to implement the following entity level intraday monitoring framework for index options to ensure market stability, while facilitating participation by various market participants including liquidity providers / market makers:

   4.1. Intraday Net position limit (FutEq basis) for each entity shall be ₹5,000 cr. (as against end of day limit of ₹1,500 cr).

   4.2. Intraday Gross position limit (FutEq basis) for each entity shall be ₹10,000 cr. (i.e. separately both on long and short sides), same as the present end of day limit.

   4.3. The aforesaid intraday limits shall continue to be monitored by Stock Exchanges through a minimum of four random snapshots during the trading day (including one snapshot between 14:45 hrs to 15:30 hrs i.e. around market closing time where heightened activity is geberally observed).

   4.4. Further, in order to monitor the intraday positions of entities, as mentioned aforesaid, the Stock Exchanges shall consider the underlying price at the time of taking positions snapshots.

**SEBI भारतीय प्रतिभूति और विनिमय बोर्ड**
**Securities and Exchange Board of India**

   4.5. Entities shall be allowed to take additional exposure against holding of securities or cash/cash equivalent, as applicable, in line with para 5.5.3 of SEBI circular dated May 29, 2025.

   4.6. For the entities breaching the aforesaid limits, Stock Exchanges shall examine trading patterns of such entities which would inter-alia include seeking rationale for such positions from the clients, examining trading in the constituents of the index by the entity and discussing such instances with SEBI in the surveillance meeting.

   4.7. On the day of expiry of options contracts, the breaches of aforesaid position limits shall additionally attract penalty/additional surveillance deposit, as decided jointly by Stock Exchanges.

   4.8. The aforesaid framework would facilitate market making activity on all trading days while putting a check on creation of outsized intraday position on the expiry day for orderly trading.

   4.9. The aforesaid framework would also provide predictability, operational clarity, and a fair balance between ease of trading and risk management.

   4.10. The aforesaid framework shall be restricted to index options only.

5. Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations are advised to prepare a joint Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) detailing modalities for intraday monitoring in line with the instant circular and submit the same to SEBI within 15 days from the date of this circular and issue an SOP to market participants before the Circular becomes effective.

6. The provisions of the Circular shall come into effect from October 01, 2025 except for the provision mentioned at para 4.7 above which shall come into effect from December 6, 2025 (i.e. at the end of glide path of FutEq based positions limits, as mentioned at Para 2 above).

7. MIIs are required to take necessary steps to put in place systems processes, and monitoring mechanisms for implementation of the Circular, including necessary amendments to the relevant bye-laws, rules and regulations, if any.

Page 4 of 4","*   **Objective:** To establish a framework for monitoring intraday position limits for equity index derivatives to enhance market stability and manage risks.
*   **Applicability:** The framework applies to all entities trading in equity index options only.
*   **New Intraday Position Limits:**
    *   **Net Position Limit (Future Equivalent basis):** ₹5,000 crore for each entity.
    *   **Gross Position Limit (Future Equivalent basis):** ₹10,000 crore for each entity (calculated separately for long and short positions).
*   **Monitoring Mechanism:**
    *   Stock Exchanges are responsible for monitoring these intraday limits.
    *   Monitoring will be conducted through a minimum of four random snapshots during the trading day.
    *   One of these snapshots must be taken between 14:45 and 15:30 hrs.
*   **Consequences for Breaching Limits:**
    *   Stock Exchanges will examine the trading patterns of entities that breach the limits and may seek a rationale for the positions.
    *   Breaches on the day of contract expiry will attract a penalty or an additional surveillance deposit, as decided jointly by the Stock Exchanges.
*   **Implementation Dates:**
    *   The circular's provisions will be effective from **October 01, 2025**.
    *   The penalty provision for breaches on expiry days will come into effect from **December 06, 2025**.
*   **Action Required from Market Infrastructure Institutions (MIIs):**
    *   Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations must prepare and submit a joint Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for intraday monitoring to SEBI within 15 days.
    *   MIIs must implement the necessary systems, processes, and amendments to their bye-laws to enforce the circular.","Here are the predictive actions for the SEBI circular on the Framework for Intraday Position Limits Monitoring for Equity Index Derivatives.

### **Predictive Actions**

---

### **High**

*   **Upgrade Risk Management Systems (RMS) and Trading Systems:**
    *   **For Brokers/Trading Members:** Immediately update internal RMS and Order Management Systems (OMS) to monitor the new intraday Net (₹5,000 cr) and Gross (₹10,000 cr) FutEq position limits in near real-time. Configure pre-emptive alerts for clients and internal desks approaching these limits to prevent breaches.
    *   **For Stock Exchanges/Clearing Corporations:** Develop, test, and deploy the technology for the random snapshot monitoring mechanism. Ensure the system can take at least four snapshots daily, including one during the critical closing period (14:45-15:30 hrs), and accurately calculate positions using the underlying price at that moment.

*   **Formulate and Submit Joint SOP:**
    *   Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations must prioritize the creation of a joint Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for intraday monitoring. This SOP must detail the monitoring process, breach reporting, and penalty mechanism. It must be submitted to SEBI within the mandated 15-day deadline from the circular's date.

*   **Update Client Policies and Communication:**
    *   Brokers and financial institutions must immediately revise their internal risk policies, client agreements, and terms of service to incorporate the new intraday limits. Proactively communicate these changes, along with the specific penalties for breaches on expiry days, to all clients, particularly large institutional traders, FPIs, and proprietary desks.

---

### **Medium**

*   **Recalibrate Algorithmic and High-Frequency Trading Strategies:**
    *   Firms using automated trading strategies for index options must conduct a thorough review and recalibration of their algorithms. Model the impact of the new hard limits on strategy performance, especially for market-making and arbitrage strategies that may build large temporary intraday positions.

*   **Establish a Breach Response Protocol:**
    *   All trading entities should create a clear, documented protocol for handling a position limit breach. This protocol should define the escalation matrix, procedures for immediate position reduction, and a framework for preparing a rationale to be submitted to the Stock Exchange upon inquiry.

*   **Conduct Staff Training and Awareness Programs:**
    *   Organize mandatory training sessions for trading, risk management, and compliance teams. Ensure they fully understand the new framework, how FutEq is calculated, the random nature of snapshots, and the severe consequences of breaches, especially on contract expiry days.

*   **Optimize Capital and Collateral Management:**
    *   Review and analyze the provision allowing additional exposure against securities or cash (as per the May 29, 2025 circular). Develop a strategy to optimize collateral allocation to manage intraday positions effectively and potentially gain a competitive advantage.

---

### **Low**

*   **Revise Expiry-Day Specific Trading Strategies:**
    *   Given that penalties for breaches are explicitly stricter on expiry days (effective December 06, 2025), firms should conduct a strategic review of their expiry-day trading playbooks. Consider de-risking or modifying strategies that rely on building large positions towards the end of the session to avoid costly penalties.

*   **Engage with Industry Bodies for Feedback:**
    *   Document the operational challenges, costs, and market impact resulting from the implementation of this framework. Share this data and feedback with industry associations (e.g., ANMI, FIA) to contribute to a collective voice for future advocacy and potential refinements to the regulation.

*   **Explore Predictive Monitoring Tools:**
    *   Investigate or develop advanced analytical tools to model potential intraday exposure under different market volatility scenarios. While snapshots are random, predictive analytics can help in more proactive position management by identifying periods of heightened risk of breaching limits.

Page 8 of 8","*   **Objective**: This circular, issued by SEBI, streamlines the process for a Know Your Client Registration Agency (KRA) to surrender its registration, ensuring an orderly wind-down of operations for both voluntary and involuntary scenarios.
*   **Mandatory Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)**: All KRAs must create and adopt a uniform, board-approved SOP for handling the surrender process. This SOP must be published on their website within 90 days of the circular's issuance and reviewed at least once every five years.
*   **Core Requirement**: The primary obligation for a surrendering KRA (Transferor KRA) is to securely transfer all its KYC records, including full audit trails, to another SEBI-registered KRA (Transferee KRA). This transfer must be seamless, without data loss, and ensure service continuity for investors and intermediaries.
*   **Oversight and Compliance**: The surrendering KRA must form an Oversight Committee to monitor the entire winding-down process. It must remain compliant with all SEBI regulations and other relevant laws (e.g., Prevention of Money Laundering Framework, Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code) throughout the transition.
*   **Voluntary Surrender Timeline**: The process is time-bound, starting from the date of the board resolution (Day T):
    *   **T+7 days**: Intimate SEBI and apply for surrender.
    *   **T+14 days**: Communicate the decision to all stakeholders (investors, intermediaries, etc.) and announce a cut-off date for new records.
    *   **T+60 days**: Complete data migration and system deactivation.
    *   **T+90 days**: Submit a final joint compliance report to SEBI.
*   **Involuntary Surrender**:
    *   In cases of financial distress, a similar process to voluntary surrender is followed.
    *   In scenarios involving regulatory action, SEBI may intervene directly by appointing an administrator, nominating a Transferee KRA, and mandating timelines to protect investor interests and market stability.
*   **Post-Transfer Obligations**: After the transfer, the surrendering KRA must settle all regulatory dues and contractual obligations and operate an investor support desk for twelve months following the final approval of surrender by SEBI.","### Predictive Actions for SEBI Circular on KRA Registration Surrender

---

### High

*   **Develop and Approve Standard Operating Procedure (SOP):**
    Immediately draft a comprehensive SOP for winding down operations, covering both voluntary and involuntary scenarios as outlined in Annexure A. This SOP must detail the process for data transfer, stakeholder communication, and selection of a transferee KRA. The draft must be presented to and approved by the Board of Directors at the earliest possible meeting to meet the 90-day deadline.

*   **Establish Oversight Committee Framework:**
    Proactively define the structure, roles, and responsibilities of the ""Oversight Committee"" that would be constituted in the event of a surrender. Identify potential internal and external members and create a charter for the committee so it can be activated immediately if a winding-down process is initiated.

*   **Publish SOP on Website:**
    Ensure the board-approved SOP is published on the company's official website within the mandated 90-day period from the date of the circular (September 05, 2025). Failure to meet this deadline is a direct compliance breach.

### Medium

*   **Conduct Inter-KRA Collaboration:**
    Initiate discussions with other SEBI-registered KRAs to ensure the developed SOP is uniform and mutually agreeable, as required by the circular for interoperability. This collaboration should focus on standardizing data transfer formats, security protocols, and communication templates to ensure a seamless transition for investors and intermediaries.

*   **Strengthen Data Governance and Security:**
    Review and enhance existing data management protocols. Ensure that all KYC records, including historical updates and modifications, have a complete and tamper-proof audit trail. Invest in or validate encryption and secure transfer technologies to ensure compliance with the data migration requirements specified in the SOP.

*   **Train Key Personnel and Conduct Drills:**
    Conduct training sessions for the compliance, IT, legal, and operations teams on the new SOP. Simulate a winding-down scenario (table-top exercise) to test the procedures, identify potential bottlenecks in data migration, and clarify roles and responsibilities during such an event.

*   **Review and Update Contracts:**
    Assess all existing contracts with intermediaries, service providers, and creditors. Identify clauses that may be impacted by a winding-down process and plan to incorporate new clauses that align with the SOP, particularly regarding the settlement of obligations and continuity of service during a transition.

### Low

*   **Integrate SOP into Business Continuity Plan (BCP):**
    Incorporate the winding-down SOP into the organization's overall Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery plans. This ensures that an involuntary surrender due to financial distress or other crises is handled as part of a structured and pre-planned response.

*   **Schedule Periodic Reviews:**
    Establish a formal calendar to review the SOP periodically, with a mandatory review scheduled at least once every five years, or sooner if there are significant changes in regulations, technology, or business operations.

*   **Enhance Stakeholder Communication Strategy:**
    Prepare draft communication templates for various stakeholders (investors, intermediaries, regulators, media) to be used in the event of a winding-down announcement. This ensures that communication is clear, timely, and consistent, minimizing market disruption and investor anxiety.

*   **Monitor for Regulatory Updates:**
    Assign responsibility to the compliance team to continuously monitor for any further circulars, clarifications, or amendments from SEBI or other statutory authorities related to KRA operations and winding-down procedures.",Passed,"The evaluation is given as the summary is clear, well-structured, and accurately captures the essential information from the source document.

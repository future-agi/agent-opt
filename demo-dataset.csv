"A few nights ago, my husband and I were watching an episode of Dragon's Den, the Canadian version of Shark Tank, and a ""social good"" company was pitching their Haitian recycling program. It was a bad business concept poorly executed, but it didn't justify one of the Dragons' responses, paraphrased below:
You're going about this the wrong way! You don't create a social good business before you become profitable. You become profitable by whatever means necessary, and then you give back! That's how business works.
Now, I'll concede that there's something to the idea that a business needs to be successful in order for a positive end to be achieved. But her response is not an unusual one in the business community, and more often than not, the American Sharks who invest in social enterprises also buy this ""the ends justifies the means"" argument. Put another way, business people as a rule - and no thanks to Capitalism - prioritize profit over social good. If some money can be thrown at a few noble causes at the end of the line, that's great. But do what you have to do to thrive, even if that means exploitation.
In an apparent attempt to combat that mindset, there are now hundreds of startup brands on the ""ethical"" market that use buzzwords like social enterprise, one-for-one, and give-back to describe themselves. One would presume by the marketing that being charitable makes a company ethical, and I've seen many ethical bloggers and influencers tout these brands as such, even when there's very little data on their supply chain. But it begs the question: can a company really be ethical if workers are not provided a living wage, if they're not working in a safe environment, and if no attention is paid to the sustainability of raw materials?
While give-back brands market themselves around the social good, how much good are they actually achieving? And is it enough?
Charitable small businesses believe that they are doing something different by placing a cause front and center in their marketing. But, on a practical level, if their supply chain isn't in order, they may not be doing much more than a conventional business. They may be even worse.
After all, those big, nasty corporations their marketing subtly critiques do the same thing.
Large corporations have a history of giving back. GE matches employees' charitable giving, Johnson & Johnson recently pledged 1 million dollars towards improving air quality around the world, and, since 2006, the BP Foundation has donated more than 218 million dollars to community initiatives around the country. Even Walmart, through its Foundation, awards grants and scholarships, and donates money in $200,000 lump sums to all sorts of relief efforts and deserving programs.
Being charitable is not a new angle. You could probably make the case that it's actually an engrained component of American enterprise, as fundamental as having a business plan. Americans really love charitable giving. In fact, in 2015 alone individual citizens and American businesses gave $373.25 billion dollars to charity.
You can look at this from a couple of perspectives. On the one hand, it's really nice to know that these hugely profitable enterprises are designating at least some of their profits to charitable giving. It's certainly better than nothing, and for the recipients of these pledges, scholarships, and funds, it can be life changing.
But it also makes it awfully convenient for these companies to never address problems in their supply chain - or even company culture within corporate offices - because as long as they claim they're being responsible, they can practically get away with murder (but, more realistically, with gross negligence when it comes to their most vulnerable workers).
So, when a nicely branded ""social enterprise"" tells me they give back, I have questions.
Where are your raw materials sourced? Who makes your product? Where? What's the wage? Have you visited your supplier? How did you choose your supplier, and why?
If they can't answer these questions with relative ease, something's wrong.
It's not that charity is bad. Charity is very good, and comes from good human emotions like empathy, love, and maybe a bit of guilt. Charity is what's needed in times of crisis - in famine, tsunami, and war.
But charity is also a bandaid placed on broken systems.
Charities, by their nature, go where there is trouble. Uprising, corruption, colonialism, exploitation, bigotry, terror. No amount of external aid, even if given in love and good faith, can correct underlying systemic issues. Sometimes, charity makes things worse.
The documentary, Poverty Inc., explores the ways in which charity has become big business, delaying permanent infrastructure and job development. In Haiti, NGOs are often so poorly managed that money simply vanishes, given to inefficient subcontractors or wasted on lavish homes.
After an earthquake devastated Haiti in 2010, Americans donated tens of millions of dollars to relief efforts. Haitian communities were inundated with donated rice, forcing local rice farmers to compete with free product, running many of them out of business. Meanwhile, an onslaught of solar panel donations threatened local alternative energy businesses. Even if individuals were helped in the short term, the local economy was now dependent on foreign aid to keep it afloat. Not only is this unsustainable, it's unethical.
Change happens when marginalized communities are empowered to transform systems of oppression into systems of flourishing.
Social good brands must realize that there are limits to charity, and that building a charitable business model without attention to the ethics of their supply chain or the long term efficacy of the nonprofits they support is both irresponsible and dangerous.
The best possible world is one in which charity no longer needs to exist because people are able to provide for their families and their communities. It is a place where individuals are valued and not exploited. Where the root causes of injustice are addressed before they can spiral out of control.
Charity is only good now because it is necessary. But the world we should be working toward is one where people are far too important to ever be turned into charity cases, where we don't get to feel good about giving.
Where we get to claim that we're good only when we know that everyone is being treated as the sacred beings they are.
In the words of John Wesley:
Do all the good you can. By all the means you can. In all the ways you can. In all the places you can. At all the times you can. To all the people you can. As long as ever you can.
So, businesses, by all means give to charity. But take it a step further by seriously scrutinizing your supply chain for the slightest sign of injustice and exploitation. Care about company culture. Care about the environment. Vet the charities you support. Treat others the way you'd like to be treated.
I originally covered this topic on my post on One-for-Ones. I'm hoping to do another post distinguishing between charity as a virtue versus ""charity, inc."" soon.",What are some of the potential negative impacts of charity as discussed in the context?,"The context discusses that charity can sometimes exacerbate problems rather than solve them. It can delay permanent infrastructure and job development, and in some cases, it can lead to mismanagement of funds. The context also mentions the situation in Haiti where an influx of donated rice and solar panels disrupted local businesses, making the local economy dependent on foreign aid. This is described as unsustainable and unethical. Furthermore, charity can also allow companies to overlook problems in their supply chain or company culture, as they can claim responsibility through their charitable actions.","The text raises several potential negative impacts of charity, particularly in the context of how it interacts with systemic issues and business practices. Here are some key points:

1. **Dependency on Aid**: The influx of charitable donations can create dependency within communities that should ideally be self-sufficient. For instance, after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, local rice farmers struggled to compete with free donated rice, leading many out of business and making the local economy reliant on foreign aid.

2. **Undermining Local Economies**: Charity can inadvertently harm local businesses by flooding markets with free or heavily subsidized goods which locals cannot compete against. This undermines their ability to sustain themselves economically and stifles entrepreneurship.

3. **Short-Term Solutions**: Charitable efforts often focus on immediate relief rather than addressing underlying systemic problems such as poverty, corruption, or inequality. While they may provide temporary assistance during crises (like famine or natural disasters), they do not contribute to long-term solutions that empower communities.

4. **Misallocation of Resources**: Poorly managed NGOs can lead to funds being wasted through inefficient subcontracting or mismanagement—essentially siphoning off resources intended for those in need without delivering tangible benefits.

5. **Lack of Accountability**: Companies engaging in charitable giving might use it as a shield from scrutiny regarding their supply chains and labor practices; if they're seen as ""doing good,"" they may evade criticism for exploitative practices elsewhere.

6. **Moral Licensing**: When companies engage in charitable acts, they might feel justified in continuing harmful business practices because they've contributed positively somewhere else—a phenomenon known as moral licensing—which does not foster genuine ethical behavior across all aspects of their operations.

7. **Superficial Engagements**: Many brands market themselves based on social good but fail to substantiate these claims with concrete actions regarding fair wages, safe working conditions, and sustainable sourcing—leading consumers into believing they're supporting ethical businesses when this is not necessarily true.

8. **Charity vs Empowerment**: The act of giving can sometimes overshadow the importance of empowering individuals within marginalized communities to address their own needs sustainably rather than relying on external charity—which may perpetuate a cycle where recipients remain passive rather than active agents in improving their situations.

9. **Cultural Imperialism**: External charities often impose solutions without fully understanding the cultural contexts or needs specific to a community; this top-down approach can disregard local knowledge and customs while undermining agency among affected populations.

10. **Inequality Reinforcement**: Charity initiatives sometimes reinforce existing inequalities by favoring certain groups over others based solely on who has access to philanthropic support instead addressing broader structural injustices affecting entire communities systematically.
  
In summary, while charity serves an important role during emergencies and crises by providing necessary relief quickly—it also carries risks that could undermine its overall effectiveness if implemented without careful consideration towards sustainability and empowerment strategies for affected populations.

1. **Distraction from Systemic Issues**: Charity can serve as a bandaid on broken systems, allowing companies to claim responsibility without addressing underlying systemic issues such as exploitation, poor working conditions, or unsustainable practices within their supply chains.

2. **Dependency on Aid**: In cases like Haiti after the 2010 earthquake, an influx of charitable donations can create dependency on foreign aid, undermining local businesses and economies. This can lead to a situation where local communities rely on external help instead of developing self-sustaining solutions.

3. **Hindrance to Local Economies**: The provision of free goods, such as rice or solar panels, can disrupt local markets by forcing local producers to compete with donated products, potentially driving them out of business.

4. **Mismanagement and Inefficiency**: Charitable efforts, especially those managed by poorly organized NGOs, can result in the misallocation of funds, with money being wasted on inefficient subcontractors or administrative expenses rather than reaching those in need.

5. **Delay in Infrastructure Development**: Charity can delay permanent infrastructure and job development by focusing on short-term relief rather than long-term solutions that empower communities and promote sustainable growth.

6. **Exploitation of Charity for Corporate Image**: Companies may use charitable giving as a marketing strategy to improve their image while continuing exploitative practices elsewhere in their operations, thus avoiding scrutiny of their supply chains or corporate culture.

7. **Potential to Worsen Situations**: In some cases, charity can exacerbate existing problems by not addressing the root causes of issues such as corruption, exploitation, or systemic inequality, and sometimes it may even make things worse.

Overall, the context suggests that while charity is necessary in times of crisis, it should not replace efforts to address and reform systemic issues that lead to inequality and exploitation.","The context discusses several potential negative impacts of charity, including:

1. **Masking Underlying Issues**: Charity can serve as a band-aid solution, addressing immediate needs but failing to tackle the root causes of systemic problems. This can delay necessary structural changes and reforms.

2. **Dependency on Foreign Aid**: In some cases, like the example of Haiti, charity can lead to dependency on foreign aid, undermining local economies and businesses. This was illustrated by the negative impact on local rice farmers and alternative energy businesses due to an influx of free or donated goods.

3. **Neglect of Supply Chain Ethics**: Companies that focus on charitable giving might neglect ethical practices within their supply chains, such as fair wages, safe working conditions, and sustainable sourcing of materials. This oversight can perpetuate exploitation and injustice.

4. **Convenient Oversight of Corporate Responsibility**: Charitable actions can provide corporations with a convenient excuse to overlook internal issues, such as problems in company culture or the treatment of vulnerable workers, as long as they maintain a public image of responsibility through their charitable activities.

5. **Inefficiency and Mismanagement**: Charitable organizations, especially in crisis situations, can suffer from inefficiencies and mismanagement, leading to wasted resources or funds not reaching those in need.

6. **Hindrance to Local Development**: Charity can sometimes hinder local development by outcompeting local businesses, as seen with the influx of donated goods that local producers cannot compete against, thus stifling local entrepreneurship and economic growth.

7. **Charity as Big Business**: The context suggests that charity can become a business in itself, potentially prioritizing the interests of donors or organizations over the actual needs of the communities they aim to help.

"Game Notes EDM vs BUF
Buffalo Sabres (Head Coach: Dan Bylsma) at Edmonton Oilers (Head Coach: Todd McLellan)
NHL Game #31, Rogers Place, 2016-10-16 05:00:00PM (GMT -0600)
Sabres 6-2

Linesmen: Ryan Gibbons, Devin Berg
Three Stars: Ryan O’Reilly; Brian Gionta; Leon Draisaitl
- OK, look, I know we’re all disgusted at a big loss to a badly injured bottom feeder like Buffalo. But it’s important not to get overly caught up in the post facto narrative your brain is going to create as it looks through the lens of that putrid score.
- The truth is that the Oilers had a sh*t ton of great chances, and whiffed on a bunch of them. And the few they didn’t whiff on were mostly stopped.
- The Sabres on the other hand had fewer and less dangerous chances, but seemingly scored on all of them (and by my count, scored on three that weren’t really chances at all!)
- Make no mistake, these were two world-class tire fires going at it, and the Oilers have a lot to clean up, just as they did after the Flames victories. But the Sabres were by far the larger and stinkier of the two tire fires. Rewatch the game if you don’t believe me (I’m doing that right now to confirm my post game comments, and yes, it hurts a lot).
- The truth is, we see this kind of thing regularly – goaltending extremes will pretty much always override whatever happens with the rest of the team. What I mean by that is that great goaltending will overcome a huge deficit in play, and bad goaltending will torch a big advantage in play. And the latter is what happened tonight.
- What’s that old saying? “Goaltending is 50% of the game – unless you don’t have it, in which case it’s 100%”. Yup.
- On a side note, the reffing was horrific, as it always is when Tim Peel is soiling the ice with his presence. But that’s not why the Oilers lost.

In the third at 5 on 3 the point shot bounds off the boards and goes to six of net where Talbot pad stops it. This about the 6:50 mark.
Pretty sure that puck goes in. Even worse for Talbots night.
I wonder, are you able to get that clip? Talbots glove hides where the puck is and he slips it out.
Hmm, interesting. Let me take a look, I think I have a way to capture it as a clip if so
Yeah, I think I see what you mean around 7:00 left. it’s certainly possible it might have been over the line, but as you say, it looks like Talbot’s glove is covering it so can’t be called anyway. Of course, officials have disallowed an Oiler goal where it was visibly over the line and not covered, so I wouldn’t put it past them to call a covered puck a goal against!",Who were the three stars in the NHL game between Buffalo Sabres and Edmonton Oilers?,"The three stars were Ryan O’Reilly, Brian Gionta, and Leon Draisaitl.","The three stars in the NHL game between the Buffalo Sabres and Edmonton Oilers were Ryan O'Reilly, Brian Gionta, and Leon Draisaitl.",0.7777137710478191,Passed,Evaluation succeeded as similarity score of 0.7777137710478191 is above the failure threshold of 0.5 using CosineSimilarity,"Response accurately provides three stars from the specified NHL game between Buffalo Sabres and Edmonton Oilers, fully addressing the question.","The three stars in the NHL game between the Buffalo Sabres and Edmonton Oilers were Ryan O'Reilly, Brian Gionta, and Leon Draisaitl.","The three stars in the NHL game between the Buffalo Sabres and Edmonton Oilers were Ryan O'Reilly, Brian Gionta, and Leon Draisaitl.",1.0,1.0,['yes'],Failed,"Response contains multiple factual errors and introduces information not present in the given context, including incorrect player names and a specific date.",0.502518907629606,Evaluation succeeded as similarity score of 0.502518907629606 is above the failure threshold of 0.5 using CosineSimilarity,"In the October 16, 2016 NHL game between the Buffalo Sabres and Edmonton Oilers, the Three Stars were Brian Gionta, Daniil Miromanov, and Miles Wood."

"Wander round St Cézaire
Explore the picturesque hilltop town, stop for a café au lait or a leisurely lunch on the square, meet the locals playing boules, and soak up the Provencal atmosphere.
Follow the Siagne
As well as exploring the attractive village of St Cézaire on your doorstep, you could follow the river Siagne downstream to Auribeau, another pretty village which clings to the hillside. The Siagne meets the Mediterranean ocean at Mandelieu-la-Napoule, with its beach and marina, and a 14th century fortified castle which was renovated in the 1920s by an eccentric American couple - the sculptor husband renovated the interior whilst the architect wife applied her talents to the gardens. The castle and gardens are open for view every day, as well as hosting regular music and arts events.
Grasse
Grasse Cathedral, dedicated to Notre Dame du Puy and founded in the 11th century, is the town's most notable landmark and contains three works by Rubens and one by Jean-Honoré Fragonard, a painter who came from Grasse. Considered as the perfume capital of the world, scents waft from the prolific boutiques around town selling fragrances from Grasse's established perfumeries.
Hilltop villages
Take your pick from several picturesque villages perchés in the region, so called because they perch precariously on the hillside; Callian, Fayence, Seillans and Mons would make a pretty circuit for a leisurely afternoon's drive.
Lake Saint-Cassien
Kayak and pedalo hire are available to explore the lake, but a drive around is also very rewarding for its ever-changing views from different angles, with the opportunity to stop off for lunch at a waterside restaurant en route.
For art lovers...
.... take a trip to nearby Mougins which has become a draw to both artists and celebrities over the years. The artist Picasso also lived and painted here with the tourist office once being his studio. There are now many galleries to visit with the museum of classical art also being present.
The Riviera
The beaches, marinas and chic boutiques of the French Riviera are easily accessible, around half an hour's drive away, with the nearest resort being Cannes-Mandelieu. The breaktaking scenic drive along the beautiful Estérel coastline is also a must-do.
The Verdon Gorge
Head northwest into the Var region to see the spectacular gorge, 25km long and 700 metres deep, formed by the Verdon river whose mineral deposits turn it a startling turquoise. Take a day to drive around the hairpin bends above the canyon, go walking or climbing in the National Park, or even hire kayaks to explore the waterways.
Hit Cannes!
If you enjoy a bit of retail therapy whilst on holiday, drive down to the shopaholic's mecca, Cannes, to seek out the designer labels. Combine with a spot of lunch at one of the many restaurants and a stroll along the famous Croisette.
Antibes makes for a lovely day out...
It has lovely sandy beaches, great restaurants and ice creams shops, and an attractive old quarter to wander round. There is also the port to explore, and landmarks such as the Cathedral and the fortress. A big attraction in the town is the Picasso Museum, which looks out over the sea and contains not only paintings but ceramics and drawings by the great artist.
Take cookery lessons
at Les Apprentis Gourmets in Cannes. Learn to cook authentic cuisine française!
Monkeying around!
'Canyon Forest' in Villeneuve-Loubet offers a treetop adventure course that kids (and energetic adults) will love, involving rope swings, nets, bridges etc in the trees. Minimum age is 8 years old and minimum height 1.3m tall. For smaller children, 'Pitchoun Forest' near Villeneuve-Loubet offers an easier course suitable for children as young as 3.
Family day out
Espace Marineland, just outside of Antibes, is a marine park with over 4000 animals, including a tropical reef aquarium, a shark tunnel, polar bears and penguins, and shows of sea lions, orcas and dolphins. On the same site, there is also the Aquasplash water park, the ‘Far West’ theme park and Adventure Golf. Plus plenty of play areas, picnic spots and restaurants.
Venture to Nice
The capital of the French Riviera, Nice, is about an hour's drive from this property. As well as offering a wealth of culinary delights at the many restaurants and cafés that line the sun-soaked streets, this vibrant city is a feast for the senses with its daily markets offering an abundance of flowers, local produce and Provençal crafts. In addition, the city is a must-visit for cultural enthusiasts, with over twenty museums and galleries, and was home and inspiration to the world famous modernist artist Henri Matisse for over 30 years.

NEW YORK (CBSMiami) – While more traditional styles of women’s underwear dominate the market, a number of independent brands are catering to a much larger market.
At the New York headquarters of Lively, the unmentionables on display aren’t necessarily meant to be kept under wraps.
“These styles look like you could wear them outside, not just under your clothes,” said Karina Mitchell.
“And they’ve certainly been styled that way,” Alexandra Alquiza responded.
Underwear is big business, and Victoria’s Secret has helped shape the industry.
According to IBIS World, in 2016, L-Brands, the parent company of Victoria’s Secret, known for its enticing looks, accounted for 83 percent of the U.S. retail lingerie market.
But Lively’s director of marketing, Alexandra Alquiza, says a growing number of women want something different.
“Ultimate comfort coupled with high style… really tapping into a new definition of sexy,” she said. “The sexy that resonates with women today is around being active and outgoing and confident.”
Athleticwear has taken off and is now finding its way into intimate apparel.
More businesses are creating a diverse range of undergarments that include larger sizes, increased comfort and styles that can blur the lines..
People who stopped by the label’s New York photo shoot seemed interested.
“I really like the more flexible casual look,” one person said.
Another person added, “As long as it’s comfortable and gives you support, that’s all that matters to me.”","What percentage of the U.S. retail lingerie market did L-Brands, the parent company of Victoria’s Secret, account for in 2016?","In 2016, L-Brands, the parent company of Victoria’s Secret, accounted for 83 percent of the U.S. retail lingerie market.","In 2016, L-Brands, the parent company of Victoria’s Secret, accounted for 83 percent of the U.S. retail lingerie market.",0.9999999999999999,Passed,Evaluation succeeded as similarity score of 0.9999999999999999 is above the failure threshold of 0.5 using CosineSimilarity,Response accurately reflects all key details from the context without errors or omissions.,"In 2016, L-Brands, the parent company of Victoria’s Secret, accounted for 83 percent of the U.S. retail lingerie market.","In 2016, L-Brands, the parent company of Victoria’s Secret, accounted for 83 percent of the U.S. retail lingerie market.",1.0,0.8,['yes'],Passed,"Response accurately reflects all key information from the context: 83% market share, L-Brands as parent company, Victoria's Secret, 2016 year, and U.S. retail lingerie market.",0.8625819491779427,Evaluation succeeded as similarity score of 0.8625819491779427 is above the failure threshold of 0.5 using CosineSimilarity,"In 2016, L-Brands, the parent company of Victoria’s Secret, held 83% of the U.S. retail lingerie market, according to IBIS World."

Although these can be handled with grinding and pickling steps, it will add to the later production sector burden, indirectly increasing production costs.","If a new fence is not stored properly before processing, several potential issues may arise:

1. **Rust Formation**: Exposure to moisture can lead to rust on the surface of the fence pipes, particularly if they are coated with protective color coatings that may be compromised.

2. **White Spots**: Improper storage conditions can cause white spots or corrosion on the pipe surface, which indicates degradation of the protective coating and can affect aesthetic quality.

3. **Surface Damage**: If pipes are stacked improperly (more than five layers), it could lead to deformation due to pressure at the bottom layers or scratches during transport, compromising structural integrity.

4. **Increased Production Costs**: Any damage such as rust or white powder formation will require additional processing steps like grinding and pickling to rectify these issues, leading to higher production costs and inefficiencies in operations.

5. **Quality Control Challenges**: Without proper inspection and handling during storage, ensuring high-quality standards becomes difficult throughout various stages from incoming inspection through production and after-sale checks.

6. **Handling Burdens for Later Production**: The need for corrective measures increases burdens on later production processes by adding extra steps that could have been avoided with proper initial care.

7. **Potential Safety Hazards**: Compromised materials due to improper storage might lead to safety hazards once installed as part of a guardrail system if their strength has been affected by rust or deformation.

Overall, inadequate storage practices can significantly impact both the quality of the final product and overall operational efficiency.

Donna,
This is a beautiful tribute to the victims of 9/11. Love the top photo of the poppies and the last lines from World War I poet, Laurence Binyon’s poem, “For The Fallen (Sept. 1914).
“They shall not grow old, as we that are left grow old:
Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.
At the going down of the sun and in the morning
We will remember them.”

"In the Tivoli Storage Manager environment where many nodes try to initiate scheduled operations simultaneously, you may need to manage scheduling throughput wisely in-order to make sure the TSM server does not get into network bottleneck. You can choose a different scheduling mode options for some schedules based upon the priority and available resources, and you can control how often client nodes contact the server to perform a scheduled operation.
Relation between SCHEDMODE and SERVERINITIATION parameters
Tivoli Storage Manager provides two scheduling modes - client-polling and server-prompted. The mode indicates how client nodes interact with the server for scheduling operations. With client-polling mode, client nodes poll the server for the next scheduled event. With server-prompted mode, the server contacts the nodes at the scheduled start time.
By default, the server permits both scheduling modes. The default (ANY) allows nodes to specify either scheduling mode in their client options files. You can modify this scheduling mode.

Also Read: How to configure TSM Client Backup & Archive Schedules ?
If you modify the default server setting to permit only one scheduling mode, all client nodes must specify the same scheduling mode in their client options file. Clients that do not have a matching scheduling mode will not process the scheduled operations. The default mode for client nodes is client-polling. The scheduler must be started on the client node's machine before a schedule can run in either scheduling mode.
By default, clients contact the server (client-polling scheduling mode and SESSIONINITIATION=CLIENTORSERVER). If SESSIONINITIATION is set to the default CLIENTORSERVER value, you can use either client-polling or server-prompted scheduling modes. The client might start sessions with the server by communicating on the TCP/IP port that was defined with a server option. Server-prompted scheduling also can be used to prompt the client to connect to the server.
You can instead prevent clients from starting sessions, and allow only the server to start sessions with clients. To limit the start of backup-archive client sessions to the server only, do the following steps for each node
- Use the REGISTER NODE command or the UPDATE NODE command to change the value of the SESSIONINITIATION parameter to SERVERONLY, Specify the high-level address and low-level address options. These options must match what the client is using, otherwise the server will not know how to contact the client.
- Set the scheduling mode to server-prompted. All sessions must be started by server-prompted scheduling on the port that was defined for the client with the REGISTER NODE or the UPDATE NODE commands.
- Ensure that the scheduler on the client is started. You cannot use the client acceptor (dsmcad) to start the scheduler when SESSIONINITIATION is set to SERVERONLY.
If you modify the default so that the server permits only one scheduling mode for the server, all clients must specify the same scheduling mode in their client options file. Clients that do not have a matching scheduling mode do not process scheduled operations.
To have clients poll the server for scheduled operations, run this command on TSM Server
set schedmodes polling
Ensure that client nodes specify the same mode in their client options files.
To have the server prompt clients for scheduled operations, run this command on TSM Server
set schedmodes prompted
Ensure that client nodes specify the same mode in their client options files.
To return to the default scheduling mode so that the server supports both client-polling and server-prompted scheduling modes, run this command on TSM Server
set schedmodes any
Client nodes can then specify either polling or prompted mode. Modifying the default scheduling mode on client nodes Users can set the scheduling mode on client nodes. They specify either the client-polling or the server-prompted scheduling mode on the command line or in the client user options file. (On UNIX and Linux systems, root users set the scheduling mode in the client system options file.

In client-polling mode, client nodes poll the server for the next scheduled event. In server-prompted mode, the server contacts the nodes at the scheduled start time.","Tivoli Storage Manager (TSM) provides two scheduling modes: **client-polling** and **server-prompted**. Here's how they function:

1. **Client-Polling Mode**:
   - In this mode, client nodes actively poll the TSM server to check for their next scheduled operations.
   - The clients initiate communication with the server at regular intervals to see if there are any tasks that need to be executed.
   - This method allows flexibility as clients can determine when they want to connect and check for updates, but it may lead to increased network traffic since multiple clients might attempt to contact the server simultaneously.

2. **Server-Prompted Mode**:
   - In contrast, in server-prompted mode, the TSM server initiates contact with client nodes at predetermined scheduled times.
   - The server sends prompts or notifications directly to each client node when it's time for them to perform their scheduled operations.
   - This approach can help reduce network congestion since only designated sessions are initiated by the server rather than having all clients polling independently.

In summary, while client-polling gives more control over timing from the client's perspective and can result in higher overall traffic due to simultaneous polls, server-prompted scheduling centralizes control and potentially minimizes network bottlenecks during backup schedules by managing communications more efficiently.",0.6968168856095739,Passed,Evaluation succeeded as similarity score of 0.6968168856095739 is above the failure threshold of 0.5 using CosineSimilarity,"Response accurately describes both client-polling and server-prompted modes of Tivoli Storage Manager, including their functions and implications, without errors or omissions.","Tivoli Storage Manager (TSM) provides two scheduling modes: client-polling and server-prompted.

1. **Client-Polling Mode**:
   - In this mode, the client nodes are responsible for contacting the server to check for the next scheduled event.

This mode requires the scheduler to be running on the client node's machine to initiate the schedule.

2. **Server-Prompted Mode**:

"How to know if you’re in love? 10 tips
Is it just a passing phase, is it a serious infatuation or this time, is it the real thing? If you can’t figure out whether what you’re feeling really is love, then it’s time to do a little soul searching and ask yourself these ten questions to find out what you’re really feeling:
1. Can you picture a future without him?
Whatever your plan is for the future, our first tip on how to know if you’re in love is this – ask yourself this question: is it him in every picture that you have those future plans with? If he’s there at your side in all your dreams of travel, children and even your career, then you must be getting pretty serious about this guy.
2. Can you discuss anything with him?
Do you feel comfortable opening up to him? If you feel that you can tell him anything, even your innermost fears and secrets, then you are on the right track. When you’re willing to be completely open and honest with someone and you trust them enough to tell them about the mistakes that you have made in the past, then you are probably in love. If everything you say is designed to impress him, though, then you may not be quite there yet.
3. Do you feel good about yourself when you’re with him?
Our next tip on how to know if you’re in love is this – if you are truly in love with a person, then being around them will bring out the best in you. Love means that you want to be with that person for the rest of your life, so he should make you feel like you can really achieve things and go places with him at your side.
4. Does he make you laugh?
At times, life can be tough enough without being miserable as well, so you need a bit of laughter in a relationship. If he makes you laugh and you can laugh comfortably with each other, then that shows you that you are at the same wavelength and comfortable enough in each other’s company to be in love.
5. Can you be yourself when you are with him?
Another good tip on how to know if you’re in love is this – if you are really in love, then you shouldn’t need to a put an act, when you’re around him. You should feel comfortable enough to let the true you come out. If you don’t feel relaxed enough to be yourself, then it is unlikely that this is true love.
6. Do you ever run out of things to talk about?
Everything seems interesting, fun and easy, when you are in love and when you’re talking to the love of your life about things. You can always tell, if a couple is really loved up by the way that they are always talking to each other. Awkward silences are not a sign of a loving couple.
7. Would you look after them if they were unwell?
Now be honest about this question, because it really can be a telling one. Some illnesses need a lot more care, than just mopping the brow and some soothing words, sometimes illness can be really messy! Would you look after him, when he got a flu?
8. Do his flaws still annoy you?
Another great tip on how to know if you’re in love is to ask yourself this question: does he do things that really bug you? If you love someone, then you love them wholeheartedly and that includes their little imperfections. If there are things that he does now, that really get under your skin, then you do need to ask yourself how much you love this person. It’s unlikely that you will get him to change his ways, and if it really was love, then you wouldn’t want him to change anyway.
9. Do you admire him? Are you proud of him?
Next question on how to know if you’re in love is this: are you proud to be seen with him and do you admire him? If you are, then that’s a good sign, because when you love someone you are proud of them and their achievements, and you love to show off your admiration and pride about them.
10. Do you value his opinion?
And finally, another tip on how to know if you’re in love is to find out the answer to this question: do you really care about what he thinks? You shouldn’t have to do things just to impress him, but you should care what he thinks. Love means that you want that special person in your life to be happy and you will go out of your way to make that happen, because he makes you happy too.

"(JollofNews) – Prof.’
Thus, the intellectual has a pride of place in the development of a country, in theorising and shaping its policy direction. Plato assigned such a role to his ‘philosopher-king’. If the ruler is not a ‘philosopher-king’ or does not have the ‘intellect’, then he or she is expected to surround himself or herself with men and women of intellect to help in such an endeavour.
Certainly, directing policy decisions or being able to engage in their formulation would require a greater understanding of their intricacies and complexities and simplifying them for effective implementation. Our policy and decision makers, at the administrative, military, academic, judicial, financial and economic levels, by virtue of their interaction with ideas which they formulate into policy directions, in my view will also fall under the category ‘intellectuals’, they play such a role. Our religious lives are also greatly influenced by the intellectuals in that realm. The ‘influencers’ at these levels are who I refer to, for want of a better term, as ‘intellectuals’.
What has been the role of the home-based intellectual in our liberation struggle from the clutches of Jammehism? Were they at the forefront of citizenship, of the fight against the dictatorship, of holding the Government accountable, of speaking truth to power, actively and courageously? Were they relevant? Did they rise up to the occasion when we needed them; when Jammeh and his group of brigands and murderers were running amok and playing dice with our lives? What role did our intellectuals play in our fight for liberation, for justice, in the 22 years we were under the Wellington boots of one man?
Granted that the government was a tyranny and shouted down all voices of dissent from within. It held the sword of Damocles around everyone’s neck. Our intellectuals gave what the Government wanted, subservience and sycophancy. They were, by and large, uninterested in local politics and in the lives and challenges of the other half, the worker and farmer in the backwaters.
It is fair to indicate, though, that there were strident voices of dissent from few of our intellectuals from in-country and the diaspora. There were men and women, outside the circle of Government, who had the courage of their conviction, spoke against tyranny and suffered privation, imprisonment and callous death. But these local voices were lonely and betrayed and they faced instances where their fellow intellectuals, instead of showing solidarity and ‘unionism’, pooh-poohed them as ‘trouble makers’ or their acts of sacrifice as foolhardy and cheap.
The Jammeh carrot and stick method, at once seductive and menacing, proved effective. Our intellectuals, I speak of the majority here, in both the public and private sectors, metamorphosed into sycophants and ‘praise singers’. They lost their capacity to speak truth to power. Instead of puncturing and demystifying the ‘myth’ that Yaya created around him, the false clairvoyance, they provided the prop for it, explaining it away and amplifying and glorifying it for the people to buy into it.
Through patronage, the loyalty of many intellectuals were bought and once they became ‘yoked to power’, they could not speak out. Through co-option, most of them became the mouthpiece of the tyranny. Through self-censorship, they could not provide the critical support and leadership that the down-trodden masses needed during those critical times. They knew he was a charlatan and a quack, yet our intellectuals praised him in his folly and ignorance. They admitted him into the circle of intellectuals and endorsed his ‘ideologies’, eccentric, idiosyncratic and incoherent, which were used to drive our development agenda. There were even some intellectuals who wrote or speak fawningly about Jammeh and his development strides’ even though it was clear these were hoisted on the petard of their own opportunism.
Defeating an entrenched dictatorship of 22 years, through the powers of people armed with nothing but a marble, and not the pen and the gun, is indeed a revolutionary act. But it is a revolution which should be perpetual- there is an ongoing struggle at the center of the earth between good and evil. We cannot be complacent or rest on our laurels because we have defeated a dictator. There are many other dictators lurking in the background, ready to take center stage if the people let their guards down; ready to dole out favours or prime themselves as the ‘saviours’ and become the new dictators.
In this new dispensation, our intellectuals must play the role expected, of providing leadership and critical advice regarding the consolidation of the freedom we have won for ourselves, contributing to the development of ideas and constructing intellectual frameworks that would guide national debates. They must distinguish themselves by their courage to stand for what is best for the country, not by their ‘silence, submission and subservience’, be defenders and protectors of human rights, and, when necessary, speak truth to power. When an intellectual has the chance to speak out against injustices, and yet remain silent, he or she contributes to the moral paralysis and intellectual barrenness of the country.
Academic freedom we should fight for and the University of The Gambia, our premier citadel of learning, should rekindle such intellectual debates. Our intellectuals must insist on autonomy, demanding autonomous spaces for intellectual activities and seizing it if need be. They must reconnect with the masses and remain, as Samir Amin averred, in ‘living and close communion with the popular classes, to share their history and cultural expression’. It cannot anaesthetise itself from the ills of society and remain a happy, fulfilled class.
Regardless the role our intellectuals will be playing, I think that if we truly want to preserve the fundamental values of a democratic society, then all of us must display a certain degree of vigilance, be willing to take responsibility for what we do or fail to do, fulfill our role as active citizens, be ready to be accountable and to hold others accountable without fear or favour, scrutinize both the intent and actions of the State and be ready to stand for the truth no matter who it will hurt.
We should endeavor to know what obligations are placed on the Government, what standards it must meet and who should be held accountability for the fulfillment of our rights. Without the understanding of the obligations of the Government vis-à-vis the citizens, and the duties and sovereign powers that citizens have, we will not be able to hold our Government accountable or stand for our rights when they are violated or denied or just partly fulfilled.",What role should intellectuals play in a new dispensation according to the context?,"In a new dispensation, intellectuals should provide leadership and critical advice regarding the consolidation of freedom, contribute to the development of ideas and construct intellectual frameworks that guide national debates. They should stand for what is best for the country, defend and protect human rights, and speak truth to power when necessary. They should also insist on autonomy for intellectual activities and reconnect with the masses.","In the context provided, intellectuals are expected to play a crucial role in shaping and guiding the new democratic dispensation following a period of dictatorship. Their responsibilities can be summarized as follows:

1. **Leadership and Critical Advice**: Intellectuals should provide informed leadership and critical advice regarding the consolidation of freedom, ensuring that the hard-won liberties are preserved and further developed.

2. **Development of Ideas**: They must contribute to the generation of ideas and frameworks that facilitate national debates on important issues, helping to steer public discourse towards constructive outcomes.

3. **Courageous Advocacy**: Intellectuals need to demonstrate courage by standing up for what is best for society rather than succumbing to silence or subservience. This includes defending human rights and advocating for justice.

4. **Speaking Truth to Power**: When faced with injustices or government overreach, intellectuals have a moral obligation to speak out against these actions, thereby combating moral paralysis within society.

5. **Promotion of Academic Freedom**: They should advocate for academic freedom at institutions like the University of The Gambia, fostering an environment conducive to free thought and open debate on societal issues.

6. **Engagement with Society**: Intellectuals must reconnect with ordinary citizens, understanding their struggles and cultural expressions while remaining grounded in reality rather than detaching themselves from societal challenges.

7. **Vigilance Against Future Tyranny**: There is an ongoing responsibility for intellectuals—and indeed all citizens—to remain vigilant against potential future dictatorships or authoritarian tendencies that may arise if complacency sets in after achieving liberation from tyranny.

8. **Accountability Mechanisms**: They should help establish mechanisms through which both government officials and citizens can hold each other accountable regarding rights fulfillment—understanding governmental obligations toward its people is vital for protecting democracy.

9. **Active Citizenship Promotion**: Finally, intellectuals ought to encourage active citizenship among all members of society by promoting awareness about rights and responsibilities while empowering individuals to engage meaningfully in governance processes.
  
In summary, intellectuals are called upon not only as thinkers but also as active participants who shape policy discussions; they must embody integrity, accountability, engagement with communities, advocacy for human rights—all essential components needed in nurturing a robust democratic culture post-dictatorship.

At the time that I ordered and downloaded Elements 10 the Adobe 'Live Chat'person told me that Elements 10 was backward compatible with Premiere Elements 4: that it WOULD allow me to use 4.
Any suggesstions, please.
Premiere Elements projects aren't even remotely backward compatible, Chik. It's impossible to open a newer version project with an older version of the program. Sorry. (It's also dangerous to try to open an older version project with a newer version of the program, by the way.)
It's best to finish your work in the project you started it.
I don't think you understand.
I have Photoshop Elements 10. I want to send my slide shows to Premiere Elements 4.
I had Photoshop Elements 6 and I had no problem sending slideshows to Premiere Elements 4.
Before I upgraded to Photoshop Elements 10, I was told (by Adobe LiveChat) that I could do the same thing from Photoshop Elements 10... and send my slideshows to Premiere Elements 4.
Was I mislead?
Yep. Sorry.
Premiere Elements 4 and Photo Elements 6 are a set. They talk to each other. (After Premiere Elements 4, Adobe made Premiere Elements and Photo Elements releases the same version number to avoid confusion.) Using the Organizer in Photo Elements 4, you can send your slideshow to Premiere Elements 4. (Technically, your slideshow is coming from the Organizer, not Photo Elements.)
Open the Organizer from Premiere Elements 10. This is the version 10 Organizer. It WILL port your slideshow to Premiere Elements 10 if you select the Send to Premiere Elements option. (Though do make sure your photos are no larger than 1000x750 pixels.)
I don’t HAVE Premiere Elements 10.
I have Premiere Elements 4 .
When I dealt with Live Chat that is why I enquired about compatibility with Premiere Elements 4.
If I had been told that Photoshop Element 10 (with Organizer) was NOT compatible with Premiere Elements 4; I would not have bought, it and instead would have considered purchasing the ‘bundled’ Photoshop Elements 10/Premiere Elements 10 combination…. But I was told the opposite so (in order to save some money) I purchased the stand-alone Photoshop 10.
If you are an Adobe representative, please email me, I will give you the order number, and forward a copy of the ‘Live Chat’ conversation and perhaps we can discuss a solution.
Thanks

Try this email address for feedback adbecare@adobe.com to Adobe",Is Adobe Premiere Elements 10 backward compatible with Premiere Elements 4?,"No, Premiere Elements projects aren't even remotely backward compatible. It's impossible to open a newer version project with an older version of the program.","It seems you're experiencing a compatibility issue between Photoshop Elements 10 and Premiere Elements 4. To clarify, Adobe has indeed made changes in the way their software versions interact over time. As you've noted, while older versions of Photoshop Elements could send slideshows to Premiere Elements 4 seamlessly, this functionality may not be preserved with newer versions like Photoshop Elements 10.

Here are some suggestions to consider:

1. **Use an Intermediate Version**: If you have access to an intermediate version of both programs (like Photoshop Elements 6 or similar), you can create your slideshow there and then send it to Premiere Elements 4.

2. **Export Your Slides as Video or Images**: You might try exporting your slideshow from Photoshop Elements 10 as a video file or individual images that you can then import into Premiere Elements 4 manually.

3. **Contact Adobe Support**: Since you've already had a conversation with Adobe Live Chat regarding this issue, I recommend following up directly through their customer support channels for more assistance on potential solutions or refunds based on the misinformation provided during your initial inquiry.

4. **Email Feedback Address**: As mentioned in your message, reaching out via the feedback email address (adbecare@adobe.com) could also provide another avenue for addressing this concern directly with Adobe.

5. **Community Forums**: Sometimes other users may have found workarounds or solutions that aren’t officially documented but could still help solve your problem—consider posting in relevant forums where other users discuss these products.

2009 Privilege 495 - Never Chartered, Circumnavigation Ready
After having circumnavigated 15 years ago on another well-known make of catamaran, my wife and I felt the Privilege 495 had the perfect blend of comfort and speed to introduce our 10-year old daughter to the life of cruising.
We purchased Dragonfly from the original owners in Australia in January 2016, and planned to spend 1 year cruising the Queensland Coast, but after settling in and enjoying our time onboard Dragonfly, we decided to extend our trip and explore the waters of Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. Having stretched our sabbatical past our initial deadline, we've decided it's now time to find Dragonfly a new owner.
We are the second owners of Dragonfly, a 2009 Privilege 495. She is in very good condition and has never been chartered.
Dragonfly's layout is galley up, with a spacious master cabin with large en suite. There are three additional cabins, two with en suites.
Dragonfly is fully equipped with features including a 7kVA Onan Cummins genset, 100L/H water maker, Sovereign stainless steel BBQ, bow sprit with gennaker, 40kg/88lb Rocna Vulcan anchor, two 54hp Yanmar engines, and much, much more.
Dragonfly is solidly built (Category A / Ocean-Going - ""designed for sailing, under normal conditions of use, in wind forces exceeding 8 on the Beaufort scale""), with a high attention to design and comfort, which makes passage making or at anchor relaxing and pleasurable.
Dragonfly is currently in the Phuket/Langkawi area. We are still living aboard so she is completely turn-key for anyone interested in setting sail immediately.
Serious inquiries only please.

"Dulce de Leche Chocolate Chip Ice Cream is the perfect summer treat. 3 ingredients and 5 minutes is all it takes to make this no churn frozen dessert!
My sister and her boyfriend visited us two weeks ago. Now he loves desserts so I wanted to make something he would truly enjoy. I was considering baking for a second but then I decided against. Too hot! The weather was way too hot for baking.
So I made no bake chocolate biscuit cake and Dulce de Leche chocolate chip ice cream instead.
I love Dulce de Leche! This thick and creamy caramel sauce can be used for anything really: a cake filling, cupcake frosting, mousse… No matter where you use it, you will be in for a treat!
Take this Dulce de Leche chocolate chip ice cream. I added thick caramel sauce to whipped cream, mixed and stirred in chocolate chips for some crunchiness. Guys, it literally took 5 minutes to make. You only need a mixer and an air-tight container! Plus a bowl where you mix everything together. That is it!
This ice cream is creamy, rich in flavor and has a nice crunch to it. You can eat it shortly after you have taken it from the freezer which is great, isn’t it? Because who wants to wait for an ice cream to thaw first before scooping it out from the container?
Not me! In fact, I am not a patient person so waiting for something always drives me super crazy! You know how it is: I want it and I want it now! By the way, I prefer eating this caramel chocolate chip ice cream with a spoon rather than licking it on a cone. What about you guys? Are you a cone or spoon person?
By the way, you can add more (or less) chocolate chips and the same goes for Dulce de Leche. The latter can also be substituted with caramel.
Dulce de Leche Chocolate Chip Ice Cream is the perfect summer treat. 3 ingredients and 5 minutes is all it takes to make this no churn frozen dessert!

"Kevin and I have been friends for many years and share a lot of similar passions for Christ and His community. As many of you know Kevin is one of the leading worship leaders in the Body of Christ and has been a mentor to many young bands including Delirious. Kevin is starting a new venture by launching the Music Coope. Rather than me taking the time to explain it I asked Kevin to do it in his own words. I encourage you check out his website and keep up with the new music that will be launched from the Music Coope.
What is the Music Coope?
Musicians have always been a cagy crew. Typically narcissistic and brooding, they are relentlessly in pursuit of euphoric inspiration that conjures heroic sensations usually reserved for superheroes and floating spacemen. Biblical accounts paint their origins in a rather suspect shade. Lucifer, the original angel of music who’s very being was interwoven with pipes and strings, was so intoxicated with ambition that he was cast down from the heavens. Jubal is the name of the first recorded musician passed down from the Hebrew oral tradition. No surprise that he is descendent from the infamous Cain who slew his brother Abel in a fit of jealous rage. When questioned by God about the whereabouts of Abel, Cain’s calloused response went something like this: “Am I my brother’s keeper?” The Music Coope is a family of musicians dedicated to being their brother’s (or sister’s) keeper. “Survival of the fittest” loses its’ intellectual glory when applied to human relationships. The Coope is about cooperation, believing artists will render their purest and best work in the context of community.
Founder and leading visionary of The Music Coope, Kevin Prosch, has a vision that harkens back to the Great Depression era. Prosch says: “Many farmers fell on desperate times in those days and for most the only means for survival was to form cooperatives, or Co-ops.” Farmers found strength and stability in pooling their financial and intellectual resources and many families and farms were rescued from abject poverty. Music Coope artists are using these same principles to create, promote and release their music while intentionally breaking down communication barriers between artists and their fans. Rather than selling out to an industry that has little regard for the artist apart from bottom-line production, Music Coope members are sowing into integrity based relationships with each other and fans of their work while creating a market place that is less “hustle” with more “flow”. Prosch says: “At the end of the day these artists are real people with families that have tangible needs just like every other human being. The Music Coope allows them to make an honest living in their craft while fans find themselves privy to an insiders look at the creative process of music making and intimate portraits of the artists themselves.” The first annual Music Coope Festival will be held June 9-11 in Amarillo, Texas. Registration information (registration discounts) and Festival details can be found at.
The Music Coope website will launch shortly and will offer fans an opportunity of membership at a very low monthly cost. Benefits will include free monthly downloads; free annual compilation CD featuring Coope artists, video diaries and interviews with Coope artists and monthly newsletters.",What is the purpose of the Music Coope?,"The Music Coope is a family of musicians dedicated to being their brother’s (or sister’s) keeper. It is about cooperation, believing artists will render their purest and best work in the context of community. Music Coope artists are using principles of pooling financial and intellectual resources to create, promote and release their music while intentionally breaking down communication barriers between artists and their fans.","The purpose of the Music Coope is to foster a supportive and collaborative community among musicians, emphasizing cooperation over competition. Founded by Kevin Prosch, the initiative aims to create an environment where artists can thrive together, sharing resources and creativity while maintaining integrity in their work. By drawing inspiration from historical cooperatives formed during difficult times, the Music Coope seeks to empower artists to make a sustainable living through their craft while also engaging fans in a more meaningful way.

Key objectives include:

1. **Community Building**: The Music Coope promotes strong relationships among artists and between artists and their audiences, encouraging collaboration rather than isolation.

2. **Integrity-Based Relationships**: It prioritizes ethical practices within the music industry, allowing artists to focus on their creative processes without succumbing to commercial pressures that often compromise artistic integrity.

3. **Support for Artists**: The co-op model enables musicians to pool financial and intellectual resources, providing them with stability and support as they navigate the challenges of making music.

4. **Fan Engagement**: By offering insights into the creative process through video diaries, interviews, newsletters, and exclusive content like downloads and compilation CDs, it fosters a deeper connection between fans and artists.

5. **Sustainable Living for Musicians**: Ultimately, it aims to ensure that musicians can earn a fair income from their art while enriching the lives of those who appreciate their work.

Through these efforts, the Music Coope aspires not only to uplift individual musicians but also to enrich Christ's community by nurturing creativity rooted in faith and mutual care.

"MEET the kinder, gentler Larry Clark. Sure, his “Wassup Rockers” contains shots of teen flesh – most notably barechested boys in boxers – but the lurid violence, sex and nudity of “Kids” (rated NC-17), “Bully” and “Ken Park” are missing.
“Wassup Rockers,” out Friday, follows the antics of Jonathan, Kico, Milton, Porky, Eddie, Louie and Carlos – young Latino skakeboarders from Los Angeles’ South Central ghetto (much like the firsttime actors who play them) who take a trip to posh Beverly Hills, where they’re hassled by cops and picked up by rich white girls. The movie is partially based on the real lives of its actors.
Some say “Wassup Rockers” is tamer and more sentimental than your other films.
I think it just reflects the kids’ lives. This is just what happened, this is the story. These are good kids, and I want to show what they’re like.
Where did you find them?
It was pure serendipity.
“Ken Park” was opening in Paris and this French magazine asked me to take some photographs in California of Tiffany Limon [his much, much, younger lover, and a star of “Ken Park”] with some of the other actors, but they weren’t around.
So we went down to Venice to find some skate kids. And there were Porky and Kico; they were 14 or 15. They were really raggedy, their shoes were falling apart and their clothes were much too little for them and they had long hair. But they had style.
We photographed them for four days. A couple months later, when I took the magazine back to them, they wanted to go skating. I ended up taking them skating every Saturday for over a year.
How much of “Wassup Rockers” is real?
The first half of the film reflects their lives in South Central, and all those stories are their stories. I didn’t make those up at all.
The second half of the film I made up.
I started thinking, what would happen if I took them into Beverly Hills and they were picked up by some white girls, and their boyfriends came and there was this fight. That was the inspiration.
What are the boys doing now?
They’re going to high school.
Do they want to be actors?
I think they’d go with the flow. Kico is a great little natural actor – who knew? I kept giving him more and more to do. I’m writing another film for him and Jonathan.
Do the kids like the movie?
They’re happy. It’s really opened up the world for them. They’re poor ghetto kids whose world was a few square blocks of South Central. Now things are happening for them.
Are they celebrities in their own world?
A little bit. Plus when the film comes out, everybody’s going to know them.
Did the Beverly Hills cops give you a hard time, the way they do the skaters in “Wassup Kids”?
The Beverly Hills skate scene with the cop actually happened with us. The gang had never been to Beverly Hills, so I took them there one morning.
They start skating, and we get busted. The cop looked just like Robert Patrick from “Terminator 2: Judgment Day.”
Are you a skateboarder?
I learned how to skate when I was in my 40s, just before I made “Kids.” I hurt myself a lot, but I can skate a little.","What is the movie ""Wassup Rockers"" based on?","The movie ""Wassup Rockers"" is partially based on the real lives of its actors, who are young Latino skateboarders from Los Angeles’ South Central ghetto.

"Moses' Prophecy of Messiah
Jesus as the Prophet like unto Moses
by John J. Parsons
Like the patriarch Joseph before him, Moses was a ""picture"" of Yeshua in various significant ways. Though he was a Jew from the tribe of Levi, he appeared as a ""prince of Egypt"" to his own people and was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians (Acts 7:22). And though he was God's chosen deliverer, Moses was initially rejected by the Israelites and then turned to the Gentiles, taking a ""foreign"" bride. After being severely tested in the desert, he was empowered by God's Spirit to become Israel's deliverer for their hour of great tribulation. Indeed, both Moses and Yeshua were ""sent from a mountain of God"" to free Israel. Both revealed the meaning of God's Name; both spoke with God ""face to face."" Moses was sent from (physical) Mount Sinai in Midian; Yeshua was sent from a spiritual ""Mount Zion"" in Heaven (Heb. 12:22). The New Testament relates that Moses and Elijah later met with Yeshua to discuss His ""departure,"" literally, ""His Exodus"" (τὴν ἔξοδον αὐτοῦ) that he would accomplish at Jerusalem to redeem the entire world (Luke 9:30-31).In the Torah, Moses foretold of the coming Messiah who would resemble him in many prodigious ways:
The LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you,from your brothers - it is to him you shall listen. (Deut. 18:15)
This verse is the only place in the entire Torah where Moses explicitly identifies himself as a prophet of the LORD. Moreover, this is also the only passage where Moses identifies the coming of the Messiah as ""a Prophet like me"" (Deut 18:15; John 6:14). In the New Testament we read that the soferim (scribes) had sent a delegation to question Yochanon the Immerser (John the Baptist), asking him two questions:
We further read that when Philip encountered Nathanael, he said, ""We have found Him of whom Moses in the law, and also the prophets, wrote - Yeshua minetzaret ben Yosef (Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph)"" (John 1:45). After Yeshua).Yeshua is the ""Prophet Like Unto Moses""In light of these passages of Scripture, here are thirty (30) ways in which Yeshua minetzeret ben Yosef indeed resembled Moses:
How, then, was Jesus a Prophet ""like Moses""?.
For had you believed Moses, you would have believed me: for he wrote of me - John 5:46

<< Return","Who was Moses a ""picture"" of according to John J. Parsons?","Moses was a ""picture"" of Yeshua according to John J. Parsons.","According to John J. Parsons, Moses is a ""picture"" of Yeshua (Jesus) in various significant ways. The comparison highlights the similarities between Moses and Jesus as both being chosen deliverers for their people, experiencing rejection, and ultimately fulfilling God's purpose through their lives. Both figures are seen as prophets who reveal the nature of God and share a close relationship with Him—Moses speaking ""face to face"" with God and Jesus being sent from Heaven.

Parsons emphasizes that Moses foretold the coming Messiah by stating that God would raise up a prophet like him (Deut. 18:15), which Christians interpret as referring to Jesus. This connection is further reinforced by references in the New Testament where it asserts that belief in Moses' writings points toward belief in Jesus.

"Hey guys, I know I’ve been a little slow to post lately, but I hope to correct this. haha
So I was lucky enough to win this gorgeous little point and shoot over the recent Christmas holidays thanks to Camera House! I was very stoked and have to give a big shout out and thanks to them. Check them out on their Facebook page:
It arrived last Friday after much anticipation from myself and I was eager to go out and give it a shoot, and I thought why not give it a little review while I am at it. After charging the battery I flicked through the menu and had a quick play with settings. It is rather basic but I found by setting it to P mode I could at least set the ISO I wanted myself, rather than rely on the camera. I was also happy to see that in the colour settings other than Fuji Color and Black and white, they had a FujiChrome emulator which I look forward to playing with, this is supposed to emulate their famed slide film colours, I stuck with standard Fuji colour for this test. I also set the camera to center point focus as I find this beneficial to nailing the shots I want. The camera was setup and I was off to run it through it’s paces.
Before I go through my thoughts and shots, I suppose I best list it’s specs:

I went straight to the backyard and snapped this shot of this orange/red flower. Now I know this is not the best shot, however it is a good test of how the camera handles reds and oranges as I find many cameras/lenses struggle with these colours, often over saturating. I found it performed rather well in this department. However it is very touch and go, and could be prone to over saturation.
(this image has been cropped)
The next thing I wanted to test was focus speed. So I grabbed my youngest dog baby doll and got a quick snap of her. The focus seemed fine and snappy. The B&W setting seemed quite nice too.
The center point focus also seemed like the focus point was fine enough to pick up fine objects as the desired point of focus. I did however note that being used to my sony nex’s that it would greatly benefit from a tilt screen, however at around $100 retail. This camera is still quite a steal.
(this is image is cropped)
The zoom does seem quite adequate and is rather quick to zoom to the longer end. It doesn’t seem to lose too much sharpness at the long end either. I was able to snap this shot sitting in a cafe quite a way away from this couple with a dog. The 25-200mm zoom is quite handy and rather good for a camera in this class.
The close focusing distance of 5cm is also very good for a camera in the class and price range and the lens still remains sharp. I feel this could be very good for those that love to play with a little macro work, getting those shots of those little bugs. haha
I did however note that there is some slight barrel distortion. Which will only really be noticed when shooting horizons… or brick walls. But again, quite adequate for a camera in this class.
One thing that did strike me upon editing these pics from the camera (basic contrast and re-size) is how ‘filmic’ the images look due to that great little CCD sensor. This is something you will not find in a CMOS sensor camera as they definitely have more of a digital look too them. I must admit I was looking forward to the possibility of this as I am also an avid film shooter and was definitely not disappointed.
I enjoyed the look so much from this nifty little light point and shoot here are a few more images from my little test walk I took it for:
So after basically putting it through it’s paces, I have to say I am thoroughly impressed with this nifty little point and shoot and can see it accompanying me in my car often when I choose not to bother taking my DSLR’s. About the only thing I could have asked for more out of it was the ability to shoot raw…but then I did not pay for it, I won it thanks to Camera House. haha
All in all this is a very good performing, simple little camera, more than capable of taking some great shots if desired and definitely worth grabbing around the $100 mark if you are looking for a new point and shoot, or like me just a carry around camera when the Mrs tells you to leave the cameras at home. haha

"Back with a bang
I should never have doubted or even felt a shred of apprehension about Bloc Party‘s studio return after a four year hiatus. Kele Okereke’s solo asides were much less than stellar but thankfully his experimental excursions seem to have benefited the band tremendously rather than hinder it.
By the time I was a fan, roughly around late 2008, opinions had already formed and solidified about their three albums and supposed progressive downfall. I went into all of them with no real expectations and was totally unaware of the growing discontent with the band’s direction. Perhaps my blissful ignorance of the critical and public incense was a factor in my near equal enjoyment and appreciation of each record’s intricacies.
Bloc Party had never let me down before, and they still haven’t. Four is a collection of songs that are lucky to exist when you consider the band’s recent history; tensions supposedly having reached boiling point after Intimacy, rumors of the search for a new singer. Four‘s name, aside from the most obvious numeral significance, seems to have another meaning; this isn’t an album that gives the impression of being dictated by one person but rather, feels like more of a team effort (yes, they are four members in the band); granted, the lyrics are still classic Okereke, which is perfectly fine considering I’ve always enjoyed his writing (it’s mostly great here, once again) but instrumentally, the album doesn’t contain a shred of the rather poor fitting electronica he’s indulged in over the past few years, that particular itch having been scratched with his solo work. (and don’t get me wrong, such elements have their place in Bloc Party but Intimacy demonstrated their limits).
Those underwhelmed by Octopus should still make the effort to check out the album in its entirety. The debut single is likely the weakest track; not bad by any means but certainly meagre in context. Instead of computerised beats, the record takes the two thirds form of honest, straightforward hard-rock, hugely reminiscent of bassist Moake’s Young Legionnaire. 3×3, Kettling, and We’re Not Good People find the quartet channeling their inner Queens of the Stone Age to fantastic effect. The remaining third, in particular Day Four and The Healing demonstrate their retained ability to create the touching, sombre, indie ballads which Bloc Party have been known and renowned for in the past. It’s a combination which works well and never falters throughout the album’s 43 minute running time.
I usually like minimalism but in the case of Four‘s cover art, I can’t help but be a little disappointed. It is a jarring choice considering the band’s history of provocative artwork. What should probably be a striking example of ‘less is more’ appeal ultimately undermines the record’s visual impact, a result of unfulfilled expectation.
I’ve looked hard but that’s about the only flaw I can really find with Four. Maybe it’s my Bloc Party fanboyism or a hunger gone unsatisfied for so long clouding my judgement, but I can’t really care when I’m still enjoying it so much after so many listens.

The reviewer expresses satisfaction with the band's return after a four-year hiatus, highlighting that the time away has led to a revitalization of their sound and creativity. Despite previous concerns about Kele Okereke's solo work, it seems to have positively influenced the band rather than detracted from it.

The album is praised for its collaborative nature, showcasing the strengths of all four band members while maintaining Okereke's strong lyrical presence. Musically, ""Four"" moves away from the less favorable electronic elements seen in their prior work and instead embraces a straightforward hard-rock sound reminiscent of other influential bands like Queens of the Stone Age. The review notes standout tracks and emphasizes that even those who were underwhelmed by the lead single ""Octopus"" should listen to the entire album as it offers much more depth.

"With each passing day, although neither team has played a game and – because it’s an evaluation period and neither staff can speak to a recruit – Rutgers puts more distance between itself and in-state rival Seton Hall.
By the end of the week, Fred Hill, Jr., will formally become the next coach of the Scarlet Knights, replacing Gary Waters, who resigned.
The Post learned that St. Anthony coach Bob Hurley is considering an opportunity to join Hill’s staff, but the timing probably isn’t right.
“Who wouldn’t want a legendary coach like Bob Hurley on his bench?” Hill said in the Wachovia Center late Sunday night after watching Villanova beat Arizona, 82-78. “But I’m not the coach at Rutgers and Bob and I haven’t had any discussions along those lines.”
Hurley has 873 wins at St. Anthony and would like to post 900 as a high school coach. He is the most respected prep coach in the Garden State and, should he ever decide to become a college assistant, would be a major coup for any Big East program.
“At this point I’m looking forward to two more years at St. Anthony,” Hurley said. “I feel I need a number to get me to shut it down and the 900 is out there. Then I think I’d like to try something else in coaching.”
Just the fact that Hill has such a strong relationship with Hurley is great news for Rutgers and bad news for Seton Hall. Seton Hall coach Louis Orr has two years left on his contract, but his status is in limbo.
Orr wants an extension, but sources said the administration at the South Orange school is not convinced Orr has established solid enough state recruiting ties. The Pirates will lose their two best players next season – guard Donald Copeland and center Kelly Whitney – and they have no recruits signed.
According to the sources, Orr is mulling three possible scenarios: He accepts a guaranteed one-year extension; he opts to leave because an extension isn’t offered; he refuses to make changes to his staff, forcing a parting of the ways.
Seton Hall athletic director Joe Quinlan did not return phone calls, but Quinlan – who will meet with Orr this week – has a list of candidates in case he needs to make a change.
Former coaches Fran Fraschilla, John Carroll and Pete Gillen could be successors if Orr does not stay. Gillen – who could also wind up at his alma mater, Fairfield – and Quinlan are longtime friends. In an interview early in the season, Quinlan praised Gillen’s work ethic and style, but prefaced it all by saying: “We have a coach.”
Carroll, one of P.J. Carlesimo’s assistants during The Hall’s glory days, coached the Boston Celtics after a stint at Duquesne.
Hofstra coach Tom Pecora, who is said to be happy in Hempstead, and George Mason coach Jim Larranaga of The Bronx are also possibilities. Both are in the midst of postseason runs – Pecora in the NIT, Larranaga in the Sweet 16.

"The rest of the game is so straighforwards and easy. I took my girlfriend, one of the people who's going to play Friday in my Aremorican Addendum playtest, and we made a character in just a couple of minutes. Hit points, armor class, weapons, everything. It took almost literally no time at all, thanks to one of the least controversial and handy house rules I ever forget that I have:
I call it the ""Ten Items or Less"" Rule. See, you can get basic items and armor for free (that's up to light armor and any one-handed item) for free, because they're practically free anyways and I'm not really picky. I don't require dynamic encumbrance counts, for one. Math at the table should be limited to figuring out one's hit rolls by subtracting THACO from the die roll, or by figuring out how much gold goes where at the end of an adventure.
But for two, you get ten items from the equipment table for free. You can have a bedroll, two torches, waterskin (water), flask(rum), two 50' ropes, tent, blanket, and 10' pole. Or you could have a hammer, 50' rope, waterskin (water), two blankets, three days of rations, a bedroll, and a tent. For free. Seriously, don't even count them, it doesn't matter. I'm not looking over your math anyways, just take ten items, stick them in a backpack, and spend your gold on weapons, armor, ammunition, that sort of thing. When you're done, though, all your gold is gone. Instead of keeping it, you get 1d6x10 silver. That's 10-60, roughly a month's wages for a skilled laborer.
See, this rule does a couple of things. Firstly, it means that players aren't agonizing over whether to spend their 5 silver on ropes at character creation. There are more interesting times to worry about gold, and that's at the table, not when we're trying to figure out who's bringing what and how. Second, it's essentially a starting package for you- you have some odds and ends, and it encourages creativity. So you've already got food, water, shelter, and light. You've got another item to bring. Should you bring parchment? What about a quill? Will we need pitons? That sort of thing.
And lastly, it means that characters start out kind of poor. You know, the driving motivation behind half of what Conan does (the other half being revenge), and all of what people do in Theives' World. It's the simplest, and easiest motivation in the world. If a night in an inn costs 1 gold, and you currently have roughly 1/6th of one gold peice, you're going to need to make back the investment you guys just now made into all of that shiny armor and weapons and stuff. Hey, night's falling. You'd better get moving, the town guard doesn't take kindly to vagrants.
All of these things are good things. You still have to spend money outside of character creation, of course, so that the rope and pitons and stuff you brought will be more expensive next time. With any luck, of course, you'll be coming back to town with 500-600 gold, so maybe it'll be time to upgrade that plate armor for once, and then spend time in town recuperating and training and all that. Without any luck, you'll come back into town broke and half dead, with the blood of henchmen on your boots, but that's neither here nor there. Come back with your shield or on it, as they say!","What is the ""Ten Items or Less"" Rule in the game context described?","The ""Ten Items or Less"" Rule in the game context described allows players to get basic items and armor for free, up to light armor and any one-handed item. Additionally, players can choose ten items from the equipment table for free. These items can be anything from a bedroll, torches, waterskin, flask, ropes, tent, blanket, pole, hammer, rations, etc. The rule is designed to simplify the game and encourage creativity among players. After selecting these items, all the player's gold is gone and they receive 1d6x10 silver instead.","The ""Ten Items or Less"" Rule is a house rule used in the context of character creation for a tabletop role-playing game, specifically within the Aremorican Addendum playtest. This rule simplifies and streamlines the process of equipping characters at the start of an adventure by allowing players to select ten items from an equipment table without having to spend any gold on them. 

Here’s how it works:

1. **Free Basic Equipment**: Players can choose basic items (up to light armor and any one-handed item) for free, which includes essentials like food, water, shelter, and light sources.

2. **Item Selection**: Each player can pick ten items from a predefined list that typically includes useful adventuring gear such as bedrolls, ropes, torches, tents, blankets, etc., without needing to worry about their cost or keeping track of encumbrance.

3. **Encouragement of Creativity**: By providing these essential items for free upfront and encouraging players to think creatively about what additional item they might want (like parchment or pitons), this rule fosters engagement with the game world right from character creation.

4. **Starting Wealth Adjustment**: Instead of starting with gold pieces after character creation (which would be spent on gear), players receive 1d6x10 silver pieces instead—representing roughly a month's wages—which emphasizes that characters begin their adventures somewhat poor and in need of motivation to seek wealth through quests.

5. **Focus on Gameplay Rather Than Math**: The intention behind this rule is also to limit unnecessary math during character creation so that players can focus more on storytelling and gameplay rather than getting bogged down in calculations related to inventory management.

"Up and down the hills
Up and down the hills in the desertRight outside our door is a small dirt road. To call it a road is a stretch I think, more like a 4 wheeler path. It goes up and down hills, around and through washes, and keeps going farther then we have been on it. Mom has been taking Torrey on this road and they are running and hiking up and down the hills. Torrey is wiped out when they get back, so it must be fun.
Torrey is so fast , good but dont go to far from mom :)

That looks like a place we would love to run around with and take Mom along too. We would be worn out, but Mom says it is not fair because she would probably be worn out too but couldn’t just lie down and sleep like us because there is always work to do. Poor moms, they have it rough! Happy Monday!

Emma, that is so true. Mom would like to crash out too, but nothing doing. That would be so fun if you came and ran with them.
Looks like a great place to get fit! Wish I was walking those hills with you! I am dying for some good exercise at this point :-)
Have a Merry Christmas!

Oh I bet you are. You’ll get there, then you can come hike the desert with us!
Roxy, you’r so cute, lying there. And about Torrey I think he has a lot of fun, running up those hills.

Roxy I lay like that sometimes its very cozy! Torrey, I get very mischievious in the park when Mom lets me off leash. I take one last look at her to let her know I am taking off and then I’m gone. Not too far before I stop to make sure she’s following me of course. That’s the whole game. Merry Christmas! Love Dolly
roxy your’e just adorable! you must be part cat because of the way you sleep all curled up.
Wow, that looked like a fun hike, but I understand why Roxy stayed home to nap. She looks so cute all curled up. When Tucker the terrier does that, we call him a Tucker ball.
Susan from LifeWithDogsAndCats.com recently posted…Story: Why do my cats love stink bugs?
Wowza, that’s some hill! That’d earn Torrey a lot of “paws” on PetsMove!
Jackie Bouchard recently posted…Monday Mischief: Something’s a Little Fishy Around Our Christmas Tree
We have a hill that steep too, I’m not as fast as Torrey, but I still beat Mom and Dad. Roxy, I can’t do that pretzel thing, but BuffyCat can. Are you taking lessons from a cat? ~Cooper

That’s a cute pose, Roxy. Not quite that way but I’ve seen the dogs curled up in some pretty strange ways.
Dropping off some woofs & huggies for a wonderful holiday and happy New Year! <3

WOW that big hill is very impressive! Were you timid?

Torrey looks like a great dog and loves to hike. Roxy does get in a comfortably uncomfortable position to sleep! I hope they both have a great Christmas with you!

Torrey is a charmer and mom is smart to let Torrey do all the hard work going up and down the hill… hoho!

"Guys flirt in many different ways, some guys are touchy feely, some just constantly make jokes, so like to talk about how tough they are. I'm a little too shy for those approaches, so I've figured out the perfect strategy for instantly winning a girl over. It's a process, so it takes time, but it's so far been effective. I'm even in this process with two girls at work.
As we've learned, I'm not the type who can walk up and get a number on the spot, some guys have the charm, or body, to overcome the creepiness of that strategy, I don't. Just like all strategies it's important to pick one that fits your strengths and weakness. My strengths almost all reside on or in my head. I don't have the hottest body, genes have decided I should remain a bit skinny, so I don't have those huge muscles the ladies love. I do have cool blue eyes, boyish good-looks, and,what many women over the years have said is my most irresistible trait, dimples.
I'm a shy person, I'm not a smooth-talker from the get-go, I like to learn things before initiating a conversation, or allow the conversation to come to me. At work, finding opportunities to talk or learn anything about an attractive girl is a bit tough.
Like I said, this is a process. I like to start out by smiling as soon as we make eye contact. For some reason girls are totally drawn in by this move. I let this continue for a few days, then I go to the ""Hey, I recognize you!"" wave along with the smile. Then finally finding an opportunity to pass in close enough proximity to get a ""Hi!"" in.
Wow, I sound like a 6th grader dealing with his first crush now that I see this in writing, surprisingly, it's totally working. The final phase is sealing the deal and opening a dialogue.
How do I plan to do this? Easy, girls love compliments, and now that she recognizes me whenever we cross paths I won't seem like I've been scouting her out. Even though I may or may not have been...
6 comments:
i can totally see how that would work. not all girls responding to the flexing braggarts.
Yeah, I'd be kind of freaked out if some random guy just came up to me and asked for my number- ""Who IS this guy?!"" Your way gets around that :)
I think this is a flippin good idea! Too bad i'm a girl and I don't know too many guys to work it on... haha oh well! I think it's a fabulous idea!
Thanks! There are some guys who just have the gift of gab, who have the guts to go up and start a conversation and walk away with a phone number, I am not one of those guys so I have to use the tools I've got!
It's really a crying shame that you're anonymous...you're exactly my type. Oh and you have freaking good taste in music.
sigh. Ah, well :P

3. **Casual Greeting**: Once some rapport has been established through these non-verbal cues, he finds an opportunity to pass by closely enough to say ""Hi,"" further solidifying their familiarity.

4. **Compliments**: When he feels comfortable enough and believes she recognizes him, he plans to give her genuine compliments during their interactions, making it seem natural rather than forced or creepy.

"Now that I am on winter break from school and have lots of free time on my hands, I have decided to post some book reviews that I wrote back before I started this site. I want to do this for two reasons. First of all, I love some of these books and would love to share them with you guys. Secondly, I know myself and my tendency to get obsessive during the semester and so, anticipating that there will probably be a posting drought in our future, I want to get some stuff posted here while I still can.
Today’s reviews are from Charles de Lint’s Newford series. If you are a fan of urban fantasy and you haven’t read any of the Newford books, you are seriously missing out. The series consists of novels and anthologies of short stories but I am going to focus on some of my favorite novels today and save the short stories for another time.
Someplace to be Flying
Someplace to be Flying is one of my favorite Newford books and, truth be told, one of my favorite books overall. If I had to recommend only one book to introduce a new reader to Newford, this would be the one. It really is de Lint at his best, creating a fascinating urban fantasy world where mythic, shapeshifting “First People” walk modern city streets. But it is characters that really shine here, characters like the Crow Girls and Jack Daw, that you can’t help falling in love with.
Promises to Keep / The Onion Girl / Widdershins
One of Newford’s MVPs is Jilly Coopercorn, an big-hearted artist with knack for seeing magical things in unlikely places. Some of the best Newford stories revolve around Jilly and her friends. Yet Jilly’s life has had its dark periods too. She has a history of abuse, of addiction and pain that she has never quite dealt with. These three books: Promises to Keep, The Onion Girl and Widdershins are a sort of trilogy that chronicle Jilly’s life and recovery in a way that could only be done in Newford. There are times when the books get a little rough to read – and I don’t recommend reading The Onion Girl without having Widdershins on standby – but they are incredible books in an incredible series and I strongly recommend them.",What is the name of the book series by Charles de Lint that the author of the context recommends?,The author recommends the Newford series by Charles de Lint.,The book series by Charles de Lint that the author recommends is the Newford series.,0.9028938981432691,Failed,Evaluation succeeded as similarity score of 0.9028938981432691 is above the failure threshold of 0.5 using CosineSimilarity,"The response provides specific information about a book series not present in the given context, violating the grounding requirement.","The name of the book series by Charles de Lint that the author of the context recommends is the ""Newford"" series.","The name of the book series by Charles de Lint that the author of the context recommends is the ""Newford"" series.",1.0,0.8,['yes'],Passed,"Response accurately identifies and describes the Newford series by Charles de Lint, matching all key points from the context.",0.6311687442672027,Evaluation succeeded as similarity score of 0.6311687442672027 is above the failure threshold of 0.5 using CosineSimilarity,"The recommended book series by Charles de Lint is the **Newford series**, an urban fantasy collection of novels and short stories set in the mythical modern city of Newford."

Then, he declared before the judges that from April 5th, 2013 he accedes to the Conspiracy of Cells of Fire, claiming also his affinity with the Informal Anarchist Federation.

"Continuing a tradition that began 60 years ago, Mercedes-Benz just unveiled their 2013 SL model. The letters “SL” have represented a blend of sport, style and comfort for six decades, but for the first time, the SL is being constructed almost entirely of aluminum, consequently tipping the scales at considerably less than its predecessor. The 2013 SL550 will become available this spring in U.S. showrooms, and compared with its successful predecessor, will serve up considerably more athletic character without sacrificing comfort, while setting new standards in the luxury roadster class.
The new SL is available with two different suspension systems, one of which is the Agility Control Suspension as standard equipment. The ABC (Active Body Control) suspension system is available as an option. Power for the SL will come from a new V8 that makes 429 horsepower; roughly 12% more despite the lower displacement, while generating 32% more torque for an increase to 516 lb.-ft. The engine features an ECO stop/start function as standard equipment, while the 7-Speed Driver-Adaptive automatic transmission has been optimized for fuel consumption and comfort. The SL550 will reach 60 mph in 4.5 seconds.
The 2013 SL combines its finely honed profile with a luxurious feel. Premium materials, perfectly finished with great attention to detail, define the style and character of the interior.. The 6th generation SL also offers a retractable hard top that can be operated using a space-saving electrohydraulic mechanism, converting the SL from coupe to roadster and back again in a matter of seconds. Two versions of the retractable hard top include either the glass or the unique panoramic roof with MAGIC SKY CONTROL.
The design of the new SL is not only aesthetically beautiful, it also boasts outstanding aerodynamic characteristics, giving the roadster top marks in its segment in three crucial areas: lowest wind noise, virtually on par with a closed sedan; the best comfort during open-air driving, meaning the roof can stay down even at high speed; and virtually no accumulation of dirt on the side windows. The SL is also perhaps the world’s safest roadster, thanks to the collision-optimized aluminum structure, standard equipment that includes PRE-SAFE and ATTENTION ASSIST, plus further assistance systems on par with the S-Class. Active Parking Assist is new in the SL. Using ultrasound sensors it can identify parking spaces and automatically steer the vehicle into the selected space.
Other new features include the unique Frontbass system that transforms the luxury sports car into a veritable concert hall with the top up or down and the highly efficient MAGIC VISION CONTROL. To coincide with the launch of the 2013 SL, Mercedes-Benz will also be offering a special-edition model, the Edition 1, for a limited period. It is superbly equipped and comes standard with AMG 19” alloy wheels, designo exclusive leather with contrasting topstitching, AIRSCARF, the Harman/Kardon Logic7 surround sound system and much more. The designo crystal silver magno special paintwork is available exclusively for the Edition 1.

Group Size
:
5
Hike Rating:
Easy
Moderate
Hard
Strenuous
Start Coordinates:
N 38 50.063, W 120 02.641
or overflow parking at N 38 50.022, W 120 02.552
End Coordinates:
Same as Start Coordinates
Car Shuttle Req'd:
No
Parking Directions:
Take Highway 50 to just west of Echo Summit, and then turn onto Johnson Pass Road (Lincoln Highway) from the road (marked with signs to Echo Lake.) Turn left on Porcupine Road, which becomes Echo Lakes road. Follow this road to the parking coordinates.
Hazards of Note:
The first couple miles of the hike are along a very rocky section of the Pacific Crest Trail. Watch footing along this route.
Crowd Factor:
Moderate to High. This is a popular entrance into Desolation Wilderness and many of its most popular destinations. Get there early on a weekend to find parking near the trailhead.
General Notes:
Find the trailhead at the south end of Lower Echo Lake, just past the lodge on the east side of the lowest parking lot. There is a kiosk here for Desolation Wilderness permits. Cross the metal bridge going across the lake outlet and pick up the trail from this spot.
NOTE:
During the summer you can choose to take the boat shuttle to the far end of upper Echo Lake from this spot for a nominal cost, and that will save you 2 1/2 miles each direction that you use this service.
Once you pass the Upper Echo Lake on the trail or from the end of the shuttle, you will see the Desolation Wilderness signpost indicating entrance into the area, and then the destination of Tamarack Lake is not far up on your left after a continued climb up to the elevation of the three lakes in this immediate vicinity.
Since this is a hike into Desolation Wilderness, you will need a day permit (free at the trailhead) and the group size limit is 12.

"Talk:The Guardian
From Uncyclopedia, the content-free encyclopedia
edit To whoever wrote this article
You should be ashamed of yourself for slandering and besmirching the name and reputation of this most glorious of newspapers. Although some of your comments may be fair- ie. the stuff about Guardian readers being the guilt-ridden bourgeoisie- some others are disgusting and caused me to vomit copiously. There is no better national English newspaper than the Guardian. This has been, is now, and will always be the case. Please save your efforts for something more deserving. ie. the Daily Mail.
- Eh, it's not thaaaat bad, but the basic thrust, ie. The Guardian is for knee-jerk leftists who aren't half as well informed as they believe they are, was done to death some time in the early 1920s, and has since stopped being funny.
- I assume by Mail you mean Mirror. Goebbels would be proud of that arse wipe newspaper.
Also it should probably be noted that a fairly large % of the writters of this article are more than likely guardian readers themselves......--The Right Honourable Maj Sir Elvis UmP KUN FIC MDA VFH Bur. CM and bars UGM F@H (Petition) 13:17, 24 December 2006 (UTC)
- I think the first post above misses the point: The Guardian is, in its own way, frequently as ridiculous as the Daily Mail. Both are politically predictable, both are read by members of the middle class who are largely cut-off from what most of the country is actually like but think they know how to run the whole world, both promote a rather simple worldview that says a small clique (""Rightwing Americans"" for the Graun, ""The Liberal Elite"" and the EU for the Mail) are responsible for everything that goes wrong in the world, and both are officially ""moderate"" in their politics (""Liberal"" and ""Conservative"" respectively) but have in-house writers (and certainly readers, judging by their websites) who are rather more extreme. I think the Guardian's the better paper because it's far more intelligent, I personally tend to agree with it more (although that's more my politics than anything else) and it's ""official"" editorial stance is rather more balanced than the Mail's. But it's still, in many ways, a paper as ripe for satirical takedown as the Mail. --Zarbag 16:00, July 20, 2010 (UTC)
edit Pinched joke
The thing about Sun readers wanting to rule the world etc is a straight steal off Yes, Prime Minister -- I don't want to remove it cos it's moderately amusing and without it the opener would be boring, but replacing it with something actually original would be good.
- Congrats your the first person to notice where it was ripped from in almost a year and a half, I think there is nowt wrong from stealing this little bit from YM/TPM given that most readers are unlikely to have seen it--The Right Honourable Maj Sir Elvis UmP KUN FIC MDA VFH Bur. CM and bars UGM F@H (Petition) 13:15, 24 December 2006 (UTC)
Well the history of The Guardian is a variant on the Wikipedia article on The Sun. When whoever wrote much of the original finds this, he will doubtless both laugh and cry ;). Seriously, as the demographics are increasingly the main thing separating newspapers rather than content or treatment we should develop this. Mark Lawson as the cultural commentator for The Sun and the Five television channel perhaps. Finger 19:11, 13 June 2007 (UTC)
edit Improvements?
This article is starting to take shape but there are still, I think, some problems:
- The ""communism"" thing - I have the same problem with this as I have with stuff about Mail readers striding around in jackboots doing stiff-armed salutes all day, namely that it's misdirected satire. The average Graun reader in the popular imagination is more of a sandle-wearing,middle-class or upper-middle-class middlebrow who, like Mail readers, gets all ""his"" opinions from his favourite paper and its columnists. He's probably a ""champagne socialist"" who's vaguely supportive of the far-left but wouldn't want to mix with them socially. He's also obsessed with the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and can divert any kind of conversation towards it (this last one seems to be largely true, judging by the CiF messageboards).
- The ""History"" section needs a complete rewrite. I think a nice angle would be the fact that the Graun used to be a Manchester-based socialist newspaper and has become a very middle-class, very very London-centric ""liberal"" (in the American sense) newspaper. Perhaps show this happening slowly over time as the flat-cap ""provincial"" socialists are pushed aside by the metropolitan types.
- Some bits of it are still very weak and a bit lazy - like the ""past editors"" bit.
- It needs more stuff about the Graun's various sections. I've already done a wee section on the various cartoons found in the paper.
--Zarbag 14:27, May 21, 2011 (UTC)
- Will consider a rewrite on the History Section as it doesn't fit with the rest of the article. --

"So today’s challenge is “find one thing for every letter of the alphabet that you’re thankful for. Sounds straight forward enough, so let’s cut right to the chase.
A – Apple Pie — c’mon…warm apple pie with a scoop of ice cream? There’s no finer dessert on earth.
B – Baseball – There were so many choices for B (Beer, Blues Music, Bourbon) but ultimately, the rhythms, the ebb and flow of a game and sharing that with family and friends….yup…it had to be baseball.
C – Children – mine, yours all of them. Take the time to discover the world through children’s eyes. You’ll be thankful too.
D – My Dynamo — it’s just amazing to watch her grow and develop everyday.
E – Eggs — so simple and yet so versatile.
F – Family – near or far. I treasure every member of my family, even if I don’t tell them that often enough.
G – Grandmas & Grandpas – our children are so very fortunate that they know their grandparents and know how much those grandparents love them.
H – Home – Whether I’m coming home from a business trip, a work day, or a trip to the grocery store, I just love pulling into my driveway and coming home.
I – Ice Cream — See the definition for “A.”
J – Jingle Bells and the whole Christmas season.
K – Kitten — she’s Mama K to you, but my Kitten fills my world, “Heart and Soul. Now and Forever.” For that and to her, I am forever grateful.
L – LEGOs – Love spending a rainy weekend afternoon with the Whirlwind dreaming up new creations and vehicles with these amazingly simple blocks.
M – Music — I’m constantaly amazed at how music energizes, motivates, inspires and touches me.
N – Nieces and Nephews – they’re remarkable.
O – Oma — it’s German for Grandma – See “G” if you need a refresher on why.
P – Poppi – It’s the family name my kids use for my dad, their grandfather. Read “G” again, if you still need to know why.
Q – Quiet Time – that sweet spot in the day when both kids and the dog are all napping. Love that.
R – Red Wine — HEY! My doctor says it’s good for my cholesterol. That’s my story and I’m sticking with it.
S – Smoochies – you have to be careful in our house. You could fall victim to a random “muchas smoochies” attack. They come out of nowhere. It’s a great stress reliever and giggle generator.
T- Taj Mahal — one of the greatest living Blues legends in music today. If you’ve never seen him perform live. Go find out when he’s coming to your town. Get tickets, go see him and experience the vibe. You can come back and thank me later.
U – Uncles and Aunts that share their time with our kids.
V -I’m drawing a blank here, but hey 25 out of 26? Those are Hall of Fame stats in Cooperstown!
W – Whirlwind – our son stuns me regularly with his observations. And when he laughs, I swear I can fly.
X – eXtra big, eXtra-gentle dogs. Specifically, Oakley our Greater Swiss Mountain Dog. I’ll provide more on her when I get back to posting on our regular cast of characters.
Y – Youth Sports – as my son has gotten into organized athletics, I’m surprised at just how rewarding I have found the coaching experience. Those kids give me far more than I could ever teach them. It’s a great adventure.
Z – The Zillions and Zillions of smiles and laughs that I’ve had the great fortune of sharing with family, friends and co-workers. From the simple silly giggles to the eye-watering, hyperventalating, stop-it-I-can’t-breathe belly busters, I cherish every moment we’ve shared and I look forward to Zillions and Zillions more.

"2017 Information Management Symposium – Summary
This turning insight into action, as summed up by Jeff Cribbs of Gartner describes the road ahead for data analysis in the health insurance industry. Trends in this year’s discussions were artificial intelligence, curated data visualization and aligning business with technology and government partnerships to source the right data.
Following are highlights from several of the discussions:
Data Visualization Keynote – Audrey Halvorson and Raji Dasari told a story about how adopting Tableau reduced IT costs for generating reports and data visualizations and provided the customer and provider with a 360-degree experience.
Customer Experience Backbone Keynote – Cindy Montgomery and Garrett Anderson put forward a new system architecture that incorporates artificial intelligence into the data analysis process. They demonstrated how a banner in their online member portal would be displayed based on the persona that the AI would associate to the member. The banner would provide a link to further information tailored to the member. He foresees integrating the Customer Experience Backbone and AI with chatbots and other interactive tools.
Member Information: The Big Picture – Brent Leland from BCBSKC talked about the importance of a good member patient index algorithm to reduce operating costs by automatically matching data records and alleviate manual data processing. Marco Weixler from ICW, who partnered with BCBSKC on the project, developed an engine based on a statistical model to automate the matching process.
Medication Reconciliation Provider Data Enablement – Allison Combs and Louis Polite presented the business and technical perspectives of BCBSM’s achievements to integrate with the MiHIN member data feed. MiHIN is a state-wide network for routing health records between interested parties. They have a publish & subscribe model and a security model for dealing with sensitive information. By integrating with the MiHIN network, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan will improve its data to offer competitive pharmacy services benefits, wellness and care management intervention benefits, and medical reconciliation programs. We look forward to hearing an update next year on the evolution of the system.
Leveraging Key Indicators to Drive Benefit Decisions – Timothy Donald presented the BCBSNJ configuration of Tableau to help with the sales process and drive the decision process.
Gartner Keynote – Jeff Cribbs presented a vision of the future of the healthcare insurance industry. A thought-provoking presentation, Jeff proposed the Health Value Management Organization (HVMO) – a transformation in the industry towards proving improved health value to the customer. The areas targeted for innovation were artificial intelligence in health IT, a member engagement hub, economics of connection and the Internet of Things like home health monitoring.
The Jonah Group team shared with attendees some of our recent work with Michigan Health Insurance providers.
- Built for a leading IPA in Michigan, HealthFocus is a web application that allows practitioners to manage patient care, their measures, and provider compliance rates & goals. The application is fully integrated with the host’s existing data warehouse.
- Also built for the data warehouse is a pair of critical processing engines. The first provides a master patient reference with heuristics for cleansing, merging, and matching duplicate and near-duplicate patient data from disparate and volatile external data feeds. The second is a HEDIS measure and conditions engine for calculation of compliance rates across a range of over one hundred different measures and across hundreds of practice offices.
With data analytics and big data being a common theme, Jonah Group’s work with AMD was of interest. We designed, built and implemented a big data system on Hadoop.
The symposium board members did a great job lining up interesting talks, facilitating good networking opportunities and providing fun entertainment. The event was a great success!

"Armagh ready for fresh promotion push
January 26, 2015
Richard Bullick
Armagh will look to inspirational All Star corner back Mairead Tennyson to effectively curb the threat of Donegal dangerwoman Geraldine McLaughlin in Sunday’s National League opener at Cloghan (2pm).
McLaughlin is the talk of the country after firing Termon to the All-Ireland Senior Club Championship before Christmas and Armagh got a glimpse of her prowess in last June’s Ulster semi-final.
But switching Tennyson to mark her that day in Lisnaskea proved an inspired decision by manager James Daly and the Silverbridge livewire looks likely to take direct responsibility again this weekend.
Tennyson and veteran vice-captain Caoimhe Morgan are a very experienced pair of Orchard defenders and the latter’s sister Sarah Marley will be back alongside them in the Armagh rearguard after missing last summer’s entire Championship campaign with a broken ankle.
The tenacious corner back’s return will presumably enable St Paul’s schoolgirl Louise Kenny to slot into the vacancy left by stalwart wing back Sharon Reel stepping back due to business pressures though the likes of Rebecca O’Reilly, Roisin Murphy, Danielle Morgan and Shauna Grey will also have their eye on a starting spot.
O’Reilly got a taste of the big-time last summer when deputising for injured Carrickcruppen clubmate Marian McGuinness in the All-Ireland quarter and semi-finals and will hopefully push hard for further opportunities now her experienced colleague has returned.
A third Marley sibling, Niamh, wasn’t fit to start that last Donegal game, in which Armagh found themselves trailing by four points early on, but played a prominent part in turning the tide following her introduction.
Armagh went on to win by six that day but Donegal have home advantage this time and have been buoyed by that Termon triumph so will want to avenge last summer’s result and start strongly as they bid to bounce back from relegation.
For their part, Armagh are determined to hit the ground running in their bid for a second successive promotion in the NFL and, although this should be a significant step-up from Division Three which they romped through with a 100 percent record 12 months ago, the Orchard outfit beat four top flight teams last summer in the Championship.
These sides spent last spring playing two League levels apart but appear well matched and are both tipped to make the play-offs along with Westmeath, with Meath and Down also hopeful of a top-four finish.
On paper this arguably looks like Armagh’s toughest game of the entire campaign and something of a baptism of fire in an otherwise favourable fixture list which has handed them five home matches out of the remaining six.
In a division dominated by Ulster sides, Daly’s ladies won’t have to leave their own province for a regular League game and, with the only other trip being to Cavan, this weekend’s road trip to beyond Ballybofey is the longest journey they will undertake.
With the table’s top two being given home semi-finals for the first time, every match counts for more than in previous seasons and although this first result will hardly define anyone’s season, both teams are expected to put their best foot forward for what should be an intriguing tussle.
Especially if former captain Mags McAlinden has hung up her inter-county boots, Daly might hand a first start to young Shane O’Neill’s shooting star Aimee Mackin in the full forward line or utilise the teenager as an impact player off the bench.
Last season’s supersub Siobhan Mackle is off to the United States on a university placement so the Armagh manager could earmark Mackin as the new ace up his sleeve to bring on in the hope of changing a tight game.
Already an established senior international in women’s soccer, prolific forward Mackin has developed physically since her brief involvement last spring and, with her 18th birthday looming in April, appears ready to contribute to the Orchard cause.
Team-mates Sinead McCleary and Niamh Henderson had both worn the orange jersey in Croke Park finals before turning 18 and ace markswoman Mackin should prove a very valuable addition to the Armagh ranks this season.
Other fresh faces in the panel include her Shane O’Neill’s club colleague Moya Feehan, Forkhill sisters Lauren and Megan Sheridan and Lissummon’s Sarah Gamble, a diminutive centre half forward who really caught the eye at club level last season.
Every manager wants increasing competition for places and developing depth is one of Armagh’s aims as they seek to build on the impressive progress of 2014 and deliver on their trio of challenging goals for this season.
Securing back to back promotions, retaining their provincial crown and reaching Croke Park in September are testing targets but Armagh have been back in training since November and are ambitious to show that last season’s surprise package are no flash in the pan.
Having initially taken time to consider their futures, the highly-regarded Daly and his impressive management team are back fully focused on taking this team to another level and the players have been working with Ireland’s top trainer Mike McGurn ahead of the new campaign.
In iconic captain Caroline O’Hanlon, Armagh have the All-Ireland Player of the Year in their ranks while the versatile McCleary and forceful centre half forward Fionnuala McKenna can go one better than their richly-deserved All Star nominations of last term.
Last season’s newcomers, Crossmaglen’s Lauren McConville and Aoife McCoy of Dromintee, got 27 starts between them in Armagh’s 14 matches in 2014 which shows how it is possible for fresh talent to force its way into what looks like a settled side.
Few will emulate her All Star status but Tennyson’s superb example last season in finding a new personal level can also inspire players to hit fresh heights and help push Armagh to greater glory.
Armagh are no longer under the wider radar and last season’s success brought the All Ireland dream back to life, but for now Daly and his players are rightly fully focused on an NFL promotion push and this Donegal game will be a tough first test of their credentials.",Who is expected to curb the threat of Donegal dangerwoman Geraldine McLaughlin in the National League opener?,All Star corner back Mairead Tennyson is expected to curb the threat of Donegal dangerwoman Geraldine McLaughlin in the National League opener.,Mairead Tennyson is expected to curb the threat of Donegal dangerwoman Geraldine McLaughlin in the National League opener.,0.9128709291752769,Passed,Evaluation succeeded as similarity score of 0.9128709291752769 is above the failure threshold of 0.5 using CosineSimilarity,"The response directly answers the question, accurately identifying Mairead Tennyson as the person expected to curb Geraldine McLaughlin's threat in the National League opener.",Mairead Tennyson is expected to curb the threat of Donegal dangerwoman Geraldine McLaughlin in the National League opener.,Mairead Tennyson is expected to curb the threat of Donegal dangerwoman Geraldine McLaughlin in the National League opener.,1.0,0.7,['yes'],Passed,"Response directly answers the question, identifying Mairead Tennyson as the player expected to curb McLaughlin's threat with relevant details.",0.7916666666666667,Evaluation succeeded as similarity score of 0.7916666666666667 is above the failure threshold of 0.5 using CosineSimilarity,Armagh’s All Star corner back Mairead Tennyson is expected to effectively curb Donegal’s Geraldine McLaughlin in the National League opener.

jfrooks@umd.edu
College Park, Md. – The University of Maryland welcomes Dr. Olivier Bauchau as the first Igor Sikorsky Distinguished Professor in Rotorcraft. Bauchau brings thirty-plus years of experience in the rotorcraft field to the university. He is a widely recognized scholar in aeromechanics of rotorcraft, multibody and structural dynamics, composite structures, and wind turbine systems.
Supported through an endowment from Sikorsky and United Technologies, the Igor Sikorsky Distinguished Professorship in Rotorcraft is part of the Department of Aerospace Engineering and serves to support enhanced research specialization in areas related to rotorcraft. Sikorsky Aircraft is a world leader in helicopter design, manufacture and service headquartered in Connecticut, and is a subsidiary of United Technologies.
Dr. Bauchau’s work on comprehensive aeromechanics analysis of rotorcraft, modeling of flexible multibody systems involving composite structures, and modeling of rotor lag dampers are pioneering efforts in the rotary-wing field. At Maryland he aims to harness research being done in computational fluid dynamics, aerodynamics, and rotorcraft to contribute to his computational modeling work in both rotorcraft and the wind energy industry.
In addition to an extensive research background, Bauchau brings strong industry and government relationships. He is the architect behind the comprehensive multibody dynamics code, DYMORE, which is widely adopted by companies like Sikorsky and Bell Helicopter, government laboratories such as NASA Ames Research Center and academic institutions. The code is used to model all aspects of helicopter design such as dynamics, aerodynamics, controls, and composite materials.
""It's very exciting to be here,"" Bauchau said. ""Maryland has always had a strong program in rotorcraft, and this professorship sends a very clear signal that Maryland continues to grow and strengthen that area of research.""
Bauchau completed his Ph.D. (1981) in Aeronautics & Astronautics at MIT in the area of Structural Dynamics. In 1983, he joined Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Aeronautical Engineering, and Mechanics, and later became Associate Professor with Tenure. In 1995, Bauchau moved to Georgia Tech as a Professor in Aerospace Engineering until 2010, when he joined the University of Michigan-Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint Institute (Shanghai, China) as a Professor. He joined Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2014 as Professor in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering.
Bauchau is a Fellow of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), and he has authored two textbooks and published 88 archival journal papers and 175 conference proceedings papers. In 2012, he received the Textbook Excellence Award from the Text and Academic Authors Association. Recognized as an outstanding teacher, Georgia Tech twice awarded him their “Thanks for Being a Great Teacher” Award, and during his academic career, he has advised 22 students who completed their Ph.D. dissertations.
Most recently, ASME recognized his numerous contributions to the field by awarding him the 2016 ASME d’Alembert Award. The award, established in 2005, recognizes his lifelong contributions to the field of multibody system dynamics.

Through one-of-a-kind online course materials and collaborative “electronic campfires” (video webinars), we will explore through personal stories and experiences, videos, published articles and books by Dr. Blumenkrantz and others with great wisdom to share. And, as a special bonus participants will receive and be guided in readings from David’s next book, published by Oxford University Press: Coming of Age the RITE Way: Youth & Community Development through Rites of Passage.
Together we will build a “Learning Community to explore:

Discovering Our Shared Story
Youth & community development through rites of passage is a whole system’s approach to help us move from “what’s my story” and “what’s your story” to “what’s our story” that is shared between youth and their community (and then their community with other communities).
If the children are indeed our future than the stories about how we educate and help them come of age are the most important stories to get right. Since 1966 Dr. David Blumenkrantz from the Center of Youth & Community has been exploring concepts, theories, stories and practices related to youth and community development. He has worked in a wide array of places co-designing and helping identify core principles related to a new story he has called youth and community development through rites of passage.
When we get the story RITE, we get our future right.
Join David, Jen, and others from around the world for this online emergent design experience that will help you become a catalyst for change and support initiating youth and community development through rites of passage. By learning to rush to reflection before action we can change the story and transform the future.
